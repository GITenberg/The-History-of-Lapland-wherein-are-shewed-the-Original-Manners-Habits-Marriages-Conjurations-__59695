<p class="noindent"><i>The Reader may please to take notice, that
the diligent and learned Author of this History,
(to the writing of which he was commanded, and
therein assisted by the Chancellor of</i> Sweden) <i>hath in the
whole work taken care to justify what he relates, from the
faith of authentic records, the testimony of Historians,
and the Discourses of</i> Laplanders <i>themselves, with
whom he had ready opportunities of converse. And this
he hath don so precisely, that having in the contexture
of his work, given a full account of what he thought observable
in the writings, or narratives to which he refers,
he afterwards constantly puts down at length the
very words of his Authors, a great part of which are in
the Swedish Tongue. Now in this Edition we have spared
our selves the labor of such repetition; which we hope will not
be regretted by the Reader, who we suppose would not have
bin much edified by them. As to the subject here discours’d
of, twill not be needfull to give a character of it. Military
Action, and those public murders in which other
Histories triumph, have no share here. Hunger, cold and
solitude are enemies that engage all the fortitude of this
People: and where so much passive valor is necessary,
we may dispense with the want of Active. Amidst the barbarity
and darkness which reign in</i> Lapland, <i>there appear
strictures of light, which will entertain the eie of
the most knowing observer; as the Stars are no less remarkable
then is the Sun it self. However the Reader will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
not fail to meet here with what may gratify his curiosity.
Warmer Climates having all the comforts and necessaries
of life plentifully bestowed upon them, are but
a more distant home; where we have little else talk’d of,
then what we daily see among oar selves: but here it is
indeed, where, rather then in</i> America, <i>we have a new
World discovered: and those extravagant falsehoods, which
have commonly past in the narratives of these Northern
Countries, are not so inexcusable for their being lies, as
that they were told without temtation; the real truth being
equally entertaining, and incredible</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">This Country doth not every where pass by the same name. By some
’tis called <i>Lappia</i>, as <i>Johann. Magnus</i> in the Preface of his history, and
<i>Saxo Grammat.</i> in his 5<sup>th</sup> book; by others <i>Lapponia</i>, as <i>Olaus Magnus</i> in
the explication of his Map of <i>Scandinavia</i>, and <i>Ziegler</i> in his description
of the Northern Countries, and before these <i>Ericus Versaliensis</i>, and after
them <i>Andr. Buræus</i>. The <i>Swedes</i> usually call the Country <i>Lapmarkia</i>, in whose
language <i>Mark</i> signifies Land; the <i>Danes</i> and <i>Norwegians</i>, <i>Laplandia</i>, and also
<i>Findmarkia</i>, as appears from <i>Petr. Claudus</i> description of <i>Norway</i>: for no one
can gather any thing else but an account of this Country, from his whole
38<sup>th</sup> Chapt. which himself too seems to intimate, when he promises more about
<i>Findmarkia</i> in his description of <i>Lapland</i>. Of i’ts being call’d <i>Findmark</i>, I
shall speak in another place; Now we will see why ’tis call’d <i>Lapponia</i> and
<i>Lappia</i>, the Etymology of which words is not yet agreed upon by the Learned.
<i>Ziegler</i> thinks they were named so by the <i>Germans</i>, from the dulness and stupidity
of the people, which the word <i>Lappi</i> signifies amongst them; but this
seems improbable, since this Country is but of late known to the <i>Germans</i>, and
none of their antient Writers make any mention of <i>Lappia</i>. Moreover, the
<i>Finlanders</i>, <i>Swedes</i> and <i>Russians</i>, who differ much in their language from one
another, as well as from the <i>Germans</i>, call it all by the same name; and the
<i>Germans</i>, who are so remote from <i>Lapland</i>, could not transmit this name to
these more Northern Countries, especially when they had little or no commerce
with them. Neither are the people so very dull and stupid; as <i>Ziegler</i> himself
afterwards acknowledges, when he confesses they are good at the needle,
and make delicate embroidered clothes. Neither can I assent to <i>Wexionius</i>’s
opinion, that the <i>Swedes</i> gave them this name from their wearing of <i>Skins</i>;
for <i>Lapper</i> and <i>Skinlapper</i> do not signify skins, but the same as the Greeks
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥάκοι</span> (in English <i>Rags</i>) from whence <i>Ol. Petr. Nieuren</i>, who writ of <i>Lapland</i>
in <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>’s time, derives their name from their coming into <i>Swedland</i>
every year with rags <i>lapt</i> about them, which is the signification of <i>Lapp</i> in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
language. But they do not deserve that name, meerly for this reason, any more
than the <i>Finlanders</i> and others, for they are generally cloth’d in good woollen
garments, as we shall shew hereafter. <i>Grotius</i> thinks they are call’d <i>Lapps</i> from
running or <i>leaping</i>, but <i>Lœpa</i>, which in the Swedish language signifies to run,
is writ with a single <i>P</i>, and the name of this Country with a double one;
and these People naturally are no great runners, tho by an art they have of
sliding over the frozen snow, they are very swift in their motions. Some think that
the Inhabitants do not denominate the Country, but the Country the Inhabitants,
as in the name of <i>Norwegians</i> and others, which seems to be strengthned
by this, because <i>Ol. Magnus</i> calls them <i>Lappomanni</i>, after the manner
of <i>Nordmanni</i>, <i>Westmanni</i>, and <i>Sudermanni</i>, in which words <i>Manni</i> signifying
<i>Men</i>, they were call’d <i>Lappomanni</i>, <i>i. e.</i> Men of <i>Lappia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Others fancy
that the name of the Country is deriv’d from <i>Lappu</i>, which in the <i>Finnonick</i>
language is <i>furthermost</i>, because it lies in the farthest part of <i>Scandinavia</i>.
There is yet another opinion which may seem no less plausible then any of the
former, which agrees as well with the signification of the word <i>Lapp</i> among
the <i>Laplanders</i> themselves, as the credit given to what has been matter of fact,
<i>viz.</i> that ’twas call’d <i>Lappia</i>, not from its situation, or other such like accident,
but from the <i>Lappi</i> that inhabited it. So that I take <i>Lappi</i> to signify
no other than <i>banish’t</i> persons, which is the genuine signification of <i>Lapp</i> in
the <i>Lapland</i> language; for the <i>Laplanders</i> were originally <i>Finlanders</i>, and
from leaving their Country may be presum’d to have took their name; and
that not of their own choosing, but the <i>Finlanders</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> imposition, with whom
to <i>Lapp</i> signifies to run away: whence the compellation seeming something scandalous,
no person of quality to this day will endure to be call’d by it, tho
from the <i>Finlanders</i> others Nations, as the <i>Germans</i>, <i>Swedes</i> and <i>Moscovites</i>,
have learnt to call them so. But they of <i>Lappia Umensis</i> stile themselves <i>Sabmienladti</i>,
and those of <i>Lappia Tornensis</i>, <i>Sameednan</i>, from the word <i>Sabmi</i> or
<i>Same</i>; the signification of which, and whence they had it, we shall see hereafter.</p>

<p>At what time this Country and it’s inhabitants were first distinguish’t by
these names <i>Lappia</i> and <i>Lappi</i>, ’tis hard to prove: ’tis certain ’twas but of late,
for the words are not found in any antient writer, neither in <i>Tacitus</i>, who
mentions their neighbours and forefathers the <i>Finlanders</i>, nor in <i>Ptolomy</i>, <i>Solinus</i>,
<i>Anton. Augustus</i>, <i>Rutilius</i>, or others, neither in Authors nearer home (not
to name <i>Jornandes</i>, <i>Paul Warnefrid</i>, &amp;c.) nor in those who have writ the
actions of <i>Heraud</i> and <i>Bosa</i>, or <i>Gætricus</i> and <i>Rolfus</i>, or King <i>Olafus</i> in the <i>Islandick</i>,
<i>Norwegian</i> or <i>Gothick</i> language: we find nothing of them in <i>Adam Bremensis</i>,
whose diligence in writing of the Northern Countries, his <i>Scandinavia</i>
sufficiently testifies; or in <i>Sturlisonius</i>, who writ very accuratly of these parts
in his own language. Therefore I cannot be so easily persuaded with <i>Grotius</i>
to believe <i>Cluverius</i>, who says they were mention’d in the <i>Peutingerian</i> Tables,
the Author of which is thought to have liv’d at least before <i>Theodosius</i>’s time,
<i>i. e.</i> 600 years before <i>Adam Bremensis</i>: how then could he, that was none of
the best Geographers, if we may beleive <i>Welserus</i>, and very far distant from
these parts, give us any account of them, since <i>Adam Bremensis</i>, who was so
near a neighbour, and had commerce with those that lived there, could give
us none? Besides, in that Table the <i>Sarmatians</i> are called <i>Lupiones</i>, with
whom the <i>Lappi</i> were nothing concerned, neither doth any antient Author say
they were seated so far Northward: wherefore the <i>Lupiones</i> there described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
are any People rather then the <i>Laplanders</i>, for at that time, when the Author
writ, they were not so much as known to any of their neighbours, the <i>Gothick</i>
<i>Norwegian</i> or <i>Danish</i> writers. The first that mentions <i>Lapland</i> is <i>Saxo Gramat.</i>
Hist. Dan. l. 5. who lived and wrote about <i>Ann.</i> 1190, and therefore was after
<i>Adam Bremensis</i> (who lived about 1077) near 130 years, in which interval this
name must needs come first in use. For <i>Saxo</i> making mention of such a Country a
great while before, in the time of <i>Frotho</i> the third contemporary to <i>Alricus</i> King
of Swedland (who they say lived before Christ) doth not prove that ’twas called so
then, but that that Country might afterwards have had this appellation; and I
am fully perswaded, that <i>Adam Bremensis</i> would not have omitted this name if
he had had any knowledge of it. Afterward <i>Er. Upsaliensis</i> speaks of it about 1470
<i>i. e.</i> almost 300 years after <i>Saxo</i>, and 200 before this present time. After them
<i>Jac. Ziegler</i> made a large and learned description of it, by which it came to be
known all over <i>Europe</i>. For however we may meet with the name <i>Lappia</i> in
<i>Saxo</i>, none but the <i>Swedes</i> and <i>Finlanders</i>, before <i>Zieglers</i> time, knew any
thing of it. And so much for the names of <i>Lapland</i>.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAP_II" id="CHAP_II">CHAP. II.</a><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Situation of</i> Lapland.</span></h2>

</div>


<p class="noindent">The true and exact situation of this Country the Antients seem not to
have sufficiently discovered. <i>Saxo</i> makes it bordering upon <i>Jamtia</i>, extending
its self as far, or rather lying as it were between <i>Helsingia</i> and <i>Finland</i>,
when in these words he says <i>the Provinces of the</i> Helsingi, Iarnberi, Iemti,
<i>with both the</i> Lappia’s, <i>as likewise</i> Finnia <i>and</i> Estia <i>paid annual tribute to one
Domarus</i>. <i>Ericus Upsaliensis</i> seems to make it a part of <i>Finland</i>, mistaking it
for a certain part of that Kingdome so called, on the one side adjoining to
<i>Swedland</i>, on the other to <i>Russia</i>, giving it a place between <i>Carelia</i> and <i>Nylandia</i>.
<i>Ol. Mag.</i> in his Table, and so his brother <i>Johan. Magnus</i> in the Preface
of his History, place it higher then the western <i>Bothnia</i>, making neighbours to it
<i>Scrikfinnia</i> furthest towards the North, and <i>Biarmia</i> towards the East; though
some<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> think there is no such place as <i>Scrikfinnia</i>, as it is certain there is none
in those parts at this day called by that name. But yet we must not slightly
pass over the unanimous opinion of so many learned men, especially <i>Saxo</i>, not
a little knowing in the Northern affairs, who have all not barely named it, but
have described the humours of the Inhabitants, their manners, habits and fashion
of their governments, with other matters belonging to them. Instead of the
<i>Scrickfinni</i> or <i>Scricfinni</i> of <i>Johan.</i> and <i>Ol. Magn.</i> I would rather read it <i>Scritofinni</i>;
and as for <i>Skidfinni</i> as <i>Adr. Buræ</i> would have it, all the Antients, what
ever else they differ in, will agree in this, that there must be an <i>R</i> in the
word. <i>Jornandez</i> calls them <i>Scretfennæ</i>, <i>Paul. Warnefrid.</i> and <i>Diacon.</i> <i>Scritobini</i>
changing <i>f</i> in <i>b</i> (of which and some other things of the like nature I
will treat in due time and place) <i>Adam Bremensis</i> <i>Scritefiani</i>: and the Greeks
agree in this writing, so that we ought not to doubt of the Latines. <i>Procopius</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
will have them sometimes <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σκριθιφίκους</span>, other times <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σκριθιφίνους</span>. Besides ’tis manifest
since the <i>Scritefinni</i> are the same with the <i>Finni</i>, whose Etymology in their
own language is from leaping,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> by an art they have, by which with crooked pieces
of wood under their feet like a bow they hunt wild beasts; they could not therefore
take their name from <i>Skidh</i>, signifying the wooden shoes themselves, but
from their leaping, <i>i. e.</i> swift running with them, which doubtless antiently
was meant by <i>Skriida</i>, and which the Author cited by <i>Warnius</i> in the 46 page
of his Lexicon confirms, where he relates the form of an oath made by <i>Hafur</i>,
that he would preserve the peace <i>Quamdiu Finnur skriidar</i>, <i>i. e.</i> as long as the
<i>Finlanders</i> continued their manner of leaping. As for the Etymology that is
there given, that it signifies their wandring up and down, ’tis altogether false,
for <i>Skridsko</i> at this day denotes those wooden shoes which they run upon the ice
with; neither doth <i>Skirida</i> signify any thing else among the Antients but to glide
along the ground, for they do not take up one foot after the other, as in common
running, but carrying themselves steady upon the frozen snow, they move
forward stooping a little, as shall be shewn hereafter. And perhaps this is the onely
cause that they are called <i>Himantopodes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> People creeping upon their knees;
which agrees exactly with these <i>Scritofinni</i>: for they hearing that <i>Skriida</i> was
to creep along, what could they fancy the <i>Scritofinni</i> to be, but People not going
like other men, but crawling forward like creeping animalls, but of this I shall
speak more at large when I come to the <i>Laplanders</i> gliding upon the ice. That
which I would chiefly evince here, is, that there are such a people rightly
called <i>Scritofinni</i>, and the Country which they inhabit is <i>Scritofinnia</i> or <i>Scritfinnia</i>,
and that there is no reason we should think there was no such place,
since there are those who are called <i>Scritfinni</i>, <i>i. e.</i> <i>Finlanders</i>, who run upon the
ice with wooden shoes, whose Country from thence may well be called <i>Scritofinnia</i>.
And the same may be urged for <i>Biarmia</i> against those that will not allow
there is any such place. For first the antient Writers making frequent mention
of it, as that Author of the History thereof, calls it often <i>Biarmaland</i> in the
old <i>Gothick</i> or <i>Islandick</i> language, who also calls the King of it <i>Hereker</i> in Ch.
7. and his two Sons, the one <i>Rœrik</i> the other <i>Siggeir</i>. <i>Saxo</i> likewise in his 9<sup>th</sup>
book, speaks of a certain King of this place, who reigned in the time of <i>Regner</i>
King of the <i>Danes</i>, making it border upon <i>Finland</i>, when he says the King of
<i>Biarmia</i> fled for refuge to <i>Matullus</i>, who then reigned in <i>Finland</i>. But now
granting there were antiently such names as <i>Biarmia</i> and <i>Scritfinnia</i>, it remains
doubtfull still whether they were distinct Countries or no. All Authors except
<i>Johan.</i> and <i>Ol. Magn.</i> seem to make them the same, <i>Procop.</i> <i>Jornand.</i> <i>Paul. Warnfrid.</i>
and <i>Adam Bremensis</i> speak of <i>Scritfinnia</i>, but none of <i>Biarmia</i>, and the Northern
writers do just contrary. <i>Saxo</i> indeed mentions them both, but not at the
same time: once in his Preface he names <i>Scritfinnia</i>, leaving out <i>Biarmia</i>, in
other places he names <i>Biarmia</i> omitting the other; from whence I am almost
of opinion that ’tis the same Country called by native Writers <i>Biarmia</i>, by
forreign <i>Scritfinnia</i>. We may add further that as <i>Adam Bremensis</i> makes <i>Scritfinnia</i>
next to <i>Helsingia</i>, the Author of the History of <i>Heraud</i> and <i>Bosa</i> sets <i>Biarmia</i>
in the same place, speaking of some Woods in it, and Rivers that emty themselves
into the <i>Sinus Bothnicus</i> or bay of <i>Ganduia</i> next to <i>Helsingia</i>. And moreover
as the <i>Scritfinni</i> are a People of <i>Finland</i>, which not onely their name, but
an old Chorographick Table commended by <i>Grotius</i> doth intimate, distinguishing
the <i>Fenni</i> into the <i>Scritfenni</i> and <i>Redefenni</i>, so ’tis probable of the <i>Biarmians</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
as well for their neighbourhood to <i>Helsingia</i>, of which before, as for their
worshipping a God by the name of <i>Jomala</i>, which is a <i>Finland</i> word, denoting
God amongst them to this day. Moreover the <i>Biarmians</i> have many
other things like the <i>Finlanders</i>, as the Art of darting, of Magic, <i>&amp;c.</i> So
that <i>Biarmia</i> may be a Colony of <i>Finland</i>, whose People were called by
Strangers, from their <i>skirring</i> along, or gliding upon the snow, <i>Scritofinni</i>. But
now supposing all this true, and that the <i>Biarmia</i> of the Ancients, and <i>Scritfinnia</i>
were the same, ’tis a question still whether <i>Lapland</i> be distinct from them
or not. <i>Joh.</i> and <i>Ol. Magnus</i> in their Geographic Tables and descriptions, make
them distinct Countries. But that cannot be; for if <i>Scritfinnia</i> and <i>Biarmia</i>
reach one way to <i>Helsingia</i> and <i>Jamtia</i>, on the other to <i>Finland</i>; if they lye so
near these Provinces, and extend to the Bay of <i>Bothnia</i> (both which have bin
demonstrated before) I do not see where <i>Lapland</i> can have any place at all.
And the same Authors are also mistaken in putting it South of <i>Biarmia</i> and
<i>Scritfinnia</i>, whereas the Antients placed these beyond it. For that they mean’t
only by <i>Biarmia</i> that which the Swedes now call <i>Trennes</i>, appears to be false from
what has bin said before: for where are any Rivers in <i>Trennes</i> that run into the
Bay of <i>Bothnia</i>? and how is it bordering upon <i>Finland</i>? Wherefore contrary to
<i>Joh.</i> and <i>Ol. Magnus</i>, I think rather that <i>Lapland</i> is the same that was first by the
Inhabitants called <i>Biarmia</i>, by Strangers <i>Scritfinnia</i>, then changing the name for
some of the reasons here produced, it came to be <i>Lappia</i> or <i>Lapponia</i>; which beginning
from <i>Jamtia</i> and <i>Angermannia</i>, goes all about each <i>Bothnia</i>, and at length
ends in the extremities of <i>Carelia</i> and <i>Finland</i>, so as to comprehend all the
whole tract from the North even to the main Ocean, the white Sea, and the Lake
<i>Ladek</i>, which are the very bounds of old <i>Biarmia</i> and <i>Scritfinnia</i>. But that it went
as far as the Ocean, the Antients seem not to have so well understood; nor indeed
<i>Johan.</i> and <i>Ol. Magnus</i>, who in those parts, have made <i>Scritfinnia</i> and <i>Biarmia</i>
different Countries from <i>Lapland</i>. So also <i>Damianus Goes</i>, who, whatever
he knew of <i>Lapland</i>, had it from them, says it extends it self to unknown
Regions, because he knew not who lived further towards the North Sea. But
the Antients have placed there, besides the <i>Scritfinni</i>, the <i>Cynocephali</i>, <i>Busii</i>,
<i>Troglodytes</i>, <i>Pygmies</i>, <i>Cyclops’s</i>,: and some others, passing by the <i>Himantopodes</i>,
of whom we have spoken before: tho in this age none doubts but the <i>Laplanders</i>
inhabit it all, and those who have sailed along those Coasts have met with none
others but <i>Laplanders</i>. In fine <i>Charles</i> the 9<sup>th</sup> King of <i>Swedland</i> in the year
1600, being desirous to know the truth of that Country, sent two famous
Mathematicians, <i>M. Aron. Forsius</i> a Swedish Professour, and <i>Hieronymus Birkholten</i>
a German, with instruments, and all necessaries to make what discoveries
they could of <i>Lapland</i>; who at their return, did certify, and make it out,
that beyond the Elevation of the Pole 73 degrees there was no Continent towards
the North but the great frozen Sea, and that the farthest point was
<i>Norcum</i> or <i>Norcap</i>, not far from the Castle of <i>Wardhouse</i>. But of this distant
<i>Lapland</i> those that are curious may enquire at their leisure, we purpose to
treat here only of that which is subject to the Government of the <i>Swedes</i>;
and this is a vast Country, thought by <i>Paulinus</i> in his history of the North,
of equall extent almost with all <i>Swedland</i> properly so called. <i>Andr. Buræus</i>
says it contains in length above 100 German miles, and in breadth 90. All
this Country comes now under the name of <i>Lapland</i>, in which all agree that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
ever described it; and if we would take an account of the Climate of it by this
vast compass of Earth, we must begin from the 64<sup>th</sup> degree of latitude, and
so to the 71; but in longitude it must extend at least to the 27<sup>th</sup> Meridian, or
more. Moreover if we will compute the longitude from journies that have bin
made thither, all hitherto have unanimously put the beginning of it about the
38<sup>th</sup> degree, and the end in the 65<sup>th</sup>. And this may suffice partly for an
account of the situation of <i>Lapland</i> in general; and partly of that which is
subject to the <i>Swedes</i>. <i>Dam. à Goes</i>, a Knight of Portugall, sets its bounds
thus in his description of Spain: <i>Lapland is divided into the Eastern and Western
part, the Bothnick Sea coming between. The extremity of it is Tornia. Eastward
it reaches to the white Lake, towards the North comprehending diverse Provinces,
and extends it self beyond all knowledge. On the West towards Island it joins to part
of Norway, and on the other side of Norway ’tis bounded with Swedland, Finland,
and both the Bothnia’s.</i> But <i>Ol. Petr. Nieuren</i> confutes this of the <i>Bothnic</i> Sea
lying between; for so part of <i>Lapland</i> would lie in <i>Finland</i> or <i>Ostrobothnia</i>,
part in <i>Westrobothnia</i>, which every one knows is false: and the very vulgar
can tell so much, that the <i>Bothnic</i> Sea comes not any where within 18 or 20
miles of <i>Lapland</i>: tho this ought not to pass beyond <i>Damianus</i>’s time, since
<i>Nieurenius</i> himself confesses in another place, that the <i>Laplanders</i> had their seat
about the <i>Bothnic</i> Sea, but that afterwards they were driven out, of which I
shall speak hereafter. I will only add here a Table of the latitudes and longitudes
of the chiefest Places, as they were taken by <i>M. Aronis Forsius</i> and <i>Hieronymus
Birckholten</i> Ann. 1600.</p>

<p>I proceed next to the disposition and nature of the Country, having first
given you a Map of it.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the temperature of the Air, and soil
of</i> Lapland.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">We have seen how <i>Lapland</i> is situate; let us next proceed to other
particularities of it. That ’tis very near the Pole appears from its latitude,
insomuch that for some months in the Summer the Sun here never sets, and
on the contrary in the Winter it never rises; which <i>Herbersten</i> says is but
forty days, and tho three hours in the night the body of it is something darkned,
so that his raies appear not, yet there is so much light, that they continue
their work all the while. Indeed the same account is not to be taken of the whole
Country, since part of it lies nearer, and part further distant from the Pole;
and of these too some parts are more East, and some more to the West, from
whence ’tis that with some of them the Sun is scarce above the Horizon for so
many daies as he pretends. And altho in the Summer it never sets and goes below
the Earth, yet neither does it rise much above it, but as it were kisses and
gently glides along the Horizon for the most part; as likewise in the Winter when
lowest it is not much beneath it: which is the reason that tho they have one continued
night for some months, yet every day the Sun comes so near, that it
makes a kind of twilight. <i>Joh. Magnus</i> saies that in the absence of the Sun there are
two twilights, one in the morning, the other in the evening, in which those poor
remainders of day provide that the night should not be utterly destructive. And
by how much the Sun is farther absent, the light of the Moon is clearer. Hence
<i>Petr. Claud.</i> saies that when the Moon shines they go a fishing, and dispatch all
other necessaries that are to be done without doors; and when it does not, if
the air be clear, even the light of the Stars so much abates the darkness, that
the horrour of the night is much lessened, and there is light enough for the
dispatch of severall businesses, which is farther assisted by the whiteness of the
Snow. The Air of <i>Lapland</i> is cold, but fresh and clear, and consequently very
wholesome, being much purified by the winds which are here very frequent and
violent. It has bin attested to me by eye-witnesses, that there rises a certain
wind out of the Sea, which beginning to blow raises presently such thick and
dark clouds even in the midst of Summer, that they utterly hinder the sight,
and in the Winter drives the snow with such force and quantity, that if any person
be surprised abroad, he hath no other remedy but to throw himself on the
ground with some garment over him, suffering himself to be quite buried in snow
till the storm is past, which don, he rises up, and betakes himself to the next
Cottage he can meet, all paths and roads being hid in the snow. But the strongest
and most irresistible winds are upon the Mountains, where they throw down all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
things they meet with, and carry them away by their violence into far distant
places, where they are never seen or heard of afterwards. Their only help against
these is to convey themselves into dens and caves. Here is rain as in other places,
sometimes more, and sometimes less, but in the midst of Summer, this as likewise
the neighbouring Countries have very seldom any at all. Snow they
have more often, and so much that in the Winter it covers all the Country, of
which they make this advantage, that they can travel the more securely in the
night; for the light of the Moon reflected from the snow, enlightens all the
fields, that they can discern and avoid any pits, precipices and wild Beasts,
that would otherwise annoy them: so convenient are the wayes for any journy,
that two rein deer will draw a greater load over the trodden snow, then a Cart
and ten Horses can in the fields at other times. These snows in some places, as
on the tops of their highest hills, remain perpetually, and are never melted by
the strongest heat of the Sun. In the upper part of <i>Lapland</i> there are Mountains
rising to such a vast hight, that the snow continues upon them Summer and
Winter, and is never dissolved, but in other places the Land is every year over-flown
with floods of melted snow. They have also very great frosts and mists,
and good store of them, which sometimes so thicken the air, that the sight is
quite obstructed, and Passengers cann’t distinguish one man from another to
salute or avoid him, tho he be come close up to them. It is so extreme cold here
in the Winter, that ’tis not to be endured but by those who have bin bred up
in it. The swiftest Rivers are sometimes frozen so hard, that the ice is more than
three or four cubits thick; and their greatest Lakes and deepest Seas bear any
burdens whatever. Nor is the Summer, which to some may seem incredible,
more moderately hot. For tho the Sun be very low, and his raies oblique, yet
lying upon them so long together, their force is strangely increast; the only allay
being from the vapors rising out of the neighbouring Sea, and from the snows,
which as well in Summer as Winter continue undissolv’d in hollow places between
the hills. As for Spring and Autumn they know neither, there being so very
little space between the extremity of cold in the Winter, and heat in Summer,
that by Strangers ’tis look’t upon as a miracle to see every thing springing fresh
and green, when but a week before all things were overwhelm’d with frost and
snow. <i>Ol. Petr. Nieuren.</i> has observed it as a memorable thing, and which he
would not have believ’d from any one had he not seen it himself, that in the year
1616, June 24, going to the Church of <i>Thor</i>, he saw the trees budding, and the
grass coming up green out of the ground, and within a fortnight after he saw the
Plants full blown, and the leaves of the trees at their perfection, as if they had
known how short the Summer was to be, and therefore made such hast to enjoy it.
Their soil is generally neither very fertile nor barren, but between both, full of
flints, stones and rocks, every where appearing high, by whose unevenness and
roughness the rest of the ground about is useless. The ground is generally very
soft and flabby, by reason of the many Lakes and Rivers overflowing, yet would
it be fit either for tillage or pasture if any would be at the pains and charge of
draining it. <i>Ol. Petrus</i> saies of the Southern part, lying under the same climate
and influence of the Heavens with <i>Bothnia</i>, that ’tis as apt to bear any grain as
the Western <i>Bothnia</i> it self, but this is not without a concurrence and aptitude
likewise of the soil: and he himself confesses in Chap. 12<sup>th</sup>, that the Land is stony,
sandy, uneven, overrun in some places with briars and thornes, and in others
nothing but hills, moores, fennes and standing waters, which are not the qua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>lities
that usually commend Land for agriculture. Then as to his urging its
verdant and rich pastures, it doth not follow that all Land which yields much
grass should be equally capable of bearing good corn. Yet doth the Land afford
plenty of grass, and that so good that their Cattel are fatned much cheaper
and sooner with it than any other thing, as also divers hearbs, but particularly
’tis happy in all kind of pot-hearbs. There are many large Woods and
Forests, especially towards <i>Norway</i>, but not very thick; likewise steep rocks
and high mountaines called <i>Doffrini</i>; upon whose naked tops, by reason of
the violence of the winds to which they are exposed, never yet grew tree.
Below these hills lie most pleasant Vallies, in which are clear fountaines
and rivulets innumerable, which emtying themselves into the rivers, at length
are carried into the <i>Bothnic</i> Sea. Their water is clear, sweet and wholesome,
only their Forests abound with stinking and standing Pools. This Country
Winter and Summer hath an incredible number of all kinds of wild beasts,
especially the lesser sorts, which suffice not only for their own use, but to drive
a great trade with their neighbours. They have Birds also of all sorts very
many, but Fish in such abundance that a great part of the Natives are entirely
fed by them. But of all these we shall speak in their proper places, I will add
no more here but this, that the Description of old <i>Finland</i> or <i>Scritofinnia</i> by
the Ancients is the same which hath bin given here of <i>Lapland</i>; to confirm
what I said before that these Countries differ only in name, and not in nature
and situation. We come now to its Division.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAP_IV" id="CHAP_IV">CHAP. IV.</a><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Division of</i> Lapland.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Those who have writ of <i>Lapland</i>, mention different divisions of it.
<i>Saxo</i> in his 5<sup>th</sup> Book, and elswhere, speaks of two <i>Laplands</i>, and after
him <i>Johannes Magnus</i> tells us, <i>that both the</i> Laplands <i>are joined together Southward</i>.
I suppose in that division they had respect to their situation, and meant
the Eastern and the Western <i>Lapland</i>: for so <i>Damianus Goes</i>, who seems to
borrow from <i>Joh. Magnus</i>, expresses it. <i>Lapland</i>, saith he, <i>is divided into the
Eastern and the Western, separated from each other by the Bothnic Sea</i>. From
whence we may gather that that part of the Country which lies on one side
of the <i>Bothnia</i>, was called the Eastern <i>Lapland</i>, and that which lies on the other,
the Western.</p>

<p>Besides this division of <i>Lapland</i>, there is another taken from the places most
frequented by the Inhabitants. For one part thereof, lying along the Coasts
of the Ocean, is from thence called <i>Siœfindmarken</i>, that is <i>the maritime Lapland</i>;
the other lying higher on the Continent, <i>Fiœldmarken</i>, that is, <i>inland
Lapland</i>: tho by some they are called simply <i>Findmarken</i> and <i>Lappmarken</i>.
This last division <i>Pet. Claud.</i> gives us in his 27<sup>th</sup> Chapter. <i>All the Sea Coasts</i>,
saith he, <i>Northward and Eastward as far as</i> Findmarkia <i>reaches, are possest by
the</i> Siæfinni, <i>or maritime Finlanders, but the mountainous and champaign Country,
by the Lapfinni, from thence named Lapmarkia or Wildfindlandia, that is wild
or savage Findland</i>. Where he calls one part of the Country <i>Lapmarckia</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
other <i>Findmarckia</i>, the one lying along the shore, and bordering on the Sea,
the other mountainous, woody, and savage, upon the <i>Terra firma</i>. And this
too may be worth our notice, that <i>Wildfinland</i> with him is that which others
call <i>Lappmarkia</i>: I suppose, because the Natives live by hunting, as those of
the other do by fishing. For he presently adds, <i>There are many thousands in
that place that feed on nothing but the flesh of wild Beasts</i>. And indeed some
there are with whom those only pass for the true <i>Laplanders</i>: as <i>Samuel Rheen</i>,
who in his 2<sup>d</sup> Chapter of his forementioned Book, tells us, <i>that besides the
Scrickfinni</i> (so he calls them that with <i>Pet. Claud.</i> are <i>Siœfinnes</i>) <i>there are
other true</i> Laplanders, <i>that live on nothing but rain deer</i>. And so from the
Natives feeding on wild Beasts, <i>Lapland</i> properly so called, is also stiled
<i>Wildfindland</i>, in opposition to <i>Findmarkia</i>, whose Inhabitants live both on
Fish and Cattel. And yet there may be given another reason for the imposition
of this name, from the many woods of that Country. <i>Olaus Magnus</i> in more
places then one calls the natives, men that dwell in woods, or <i>Savages</i>: as in the
title of his 3<sup>d</sup> Chapt. of his 4<sup>th</sup> Book, which is, <i>Concerning the fierceness of the</i>
Savages, <i>or those that dwell in woods</i>, in which Chapter he describes the <i>Laplanders</i>.
And in the following Chapter he says, <i>that the wild</i> Laplanders <i>are
clothed with rich skins of several Beasts</i>. The Baron <i>Herberstenius</i> also in his History
of <i>Moscovy</i>, calls them <i>Savage Laplanders, who tho they dwell</i>, says he, <i>on
the Sea Coast in little Cottages, and lead a brutish kind of life, are yet more civilized
then the Savages of Lapland</i>: whence ’tis plain, that by the <i>Findlanders</i>
living near the Sea, he means those that others call <i>Siœfinnes</i>, and by the <i>Savage
Laplanders</i> those that possess the inland Country, who he thinks were
so called from their wildness and barbarity. And by and by he adds, <i>that by
converse with Strangers, who come thither to trade, they begin to lay aside their
Savage nature, and become a little more civilized</i>. Afterwards he calls them
<i>Diki Loppi</i>, which name the <i>Moscovites</i> give them at this time, as hath been
shewed elswhere.</p>

<p>There is also a 3<sup>d</sup> Division of <i>Lapland</i>, that respects the several Princes
to whom the Country is in subjection. And this <i>Andr. Buræus</i> intends, when
he tells us, <i>The greatest part of</i> Lapland, viz. <i>the Southern and inland Country,
belongs all to the Kingdom of Sweden: The maritime tract, that lies on the Ocean,
and is called Findmark (whose Inhabitants the</i> Siœfinni, <i>or maritime Findlanders,
are so named from their living by fishing) to Norway: The rest of them that dwell
from the</i> Castle of Warhuus <i>to the mouth of the</i> white Sea, <i>are subject to the
Russians, which part the Swedes call Trennes, the Natives Pyhinienni, and the
Russians Tarchana voloch</i>. Of their subjection to these severall Princes, we shall
speak when we come to treat of their Government; and also of those parts
that belong to <i>Norway</i> or <i>Denmark</i>, and <i>Russia</i>. At present we shall only
mention the division of that part which is under the <i>Swedes</i>, and is named
by <i>Buræus</i>, the Southern and inland <i>Lapland</i>, and by <i>Petr. Claud.</i> <i>Lappmarkia</i>
properly so called. This is divided into six lesser parts called <i>marker</i>,
or <i>lands</i>, tho <i>Buræus</i> chuses to render them Territories or Provinces. Each
of these have their distinct names, and are called <i>Aongermandlandslapmark</i>,
<i>Umalappmark</i>, <i>Pithalappmark</i>, <i>Lulalapmark</i>, <i>Tornalapmark</i>, <i>Kiemilapmark</i>.
So <i>Samuel Rheen</i> in his first Chapter, <i>That part of</i> Lapland <i>which belongs
to Sweden is divided into the Kiemensian, Tornensian, Lulensian, Pithensian,
Umensian, and Angermanlandensian Lapmark</i>. <i>Buræus</i> mentions but five of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Provinces, viz. <i>Umalappmark</i>, <i>Pithalappmark</i>, <i>Lulalapmark</i>, <i>Tornelapmark</i>,
and <i>Kimilapmark</i>, comprehending <i>Angermandlandslapmark</i> under <i>Umalapmark</i>,
not that they are one and the same Province, but because they are both governed
by one Lieutenant. Each of these Provinces take their name from Rivers
that run thro the midst of them, as <i>Wexionius</i> in his description of <i>Swedland</i>
assures us. As for their situation, <i>Angermanlandslapmark</i> borders upon
<i>Andermannia</i> and <i>Jemtia</i>, to this joins <i>Umalapmark</i>, next to that is <i>Pithalapmark</i>,
and then <i>Lulelapmark</i>, all of them lying Westward, reaching on
one side to that ridg of Hills that divides <i>Swedland</i> from <i>Norway</i>, and on the
other side to the Western <i>Bothnia</i>. Northward of them lies <i>Tornelapmark</i>,
and extends it self from the fartheh corner of the <i>Bay of Bothnia</i> all along
the North Sea, called by Seamen <i>Cape Noort</i>. Next to this lies <i>Kimilapmark</i>,
winding from the North toward the East, and bounded on one side by the Eastern
<i>Bothnia</i>, on another side by that part of <i>Lapland</i> that belongs to <i>Russia</i>,
and on a third side by <i>Cajania</i> and <i>Carelia</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover these Provinces we are speaking of, are subdivided into lesser
parts, called by the <i>Swedes</i> <i>Byar</i>, as <i>Samuel Rheen</i> tells us, and are equivalent
to our <i>Shires</i>, and the <i>Pagi</i> of the Ancients. So in <i>Cæsar</i> we meet with
<i>Pagus Tigurinus</i>, and <i>Pagi Suevorum</i>, which were not Villages or Country
Towns, but large parts of a Country, such as the <i>Greeks</i> called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νόμοι</span>, used
in ancient times in the division of Ægypt. Hence the <i>Glossary</i> renders the ancient
<i>Toparchiæ</i>, <i>Pagus</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοπαρχία, χώρα, νόμος</span>. There are several of these
<i>Pagi</i> or <i>Shires</i> in each Province, except <i>Angermanlandslapmark</i>, which makes
but one <i>Pagus</i>, vulgarly called <i>Aosahla</i>. <i>Umalapmark</i> hath four, <i>Uma</i>, <i>Lais</i>
or <i>Raanby</i>, <i>Granby</i>, and <i>Vapsteen</i>. <i>Pithalapmark</i> seven, <i>Graotreskby</i>, <i>Arfwejerfsby</i>,
<i>Lochteby</i>, <i>Arrieplogsby</i>, <i>Wisierfby</i>, <i>Norrvesterby</i>, <i>Westerby</i>. <i>Lulalapmark</i>
five, <i>Jochmoch</i>, <i>Sochjoch</i>, <i>Torpinjaur</i>, <i>Zerkislocht</i>, and <i>Rautomjaur</i>.
<i>Tornelapmark</i> eight, <i>Tingawaara</i>, <i>Siggewaara</i>, <i>Sondewara</i>, <i>Ronolaby</i>, <i>Pellejerf</i>,
<i>Kiedkajerf</i>, <i>Mansialka</i>, <i>Saodankyla</i>, <i>Kithilaby</i>. So that all the Territories
or Provinces are divided into 33 <i>Byars</i>. In each of these there are several
<i>Clans</i> or Families, which the <i>Swedes</i> call <i>rakar</i>, each of which have a certain
allotment of ground assign’d them for the maintenance of themselves and
their Cattel; not in the nature of a Country Farm with us, but of a very
great length and bredth, so as to include Rivers, Lakes, Woods, and the
like, which all belong to one <i>Clan</i> or family. In every <i>Biar</i> there are as many
allotments as there are families that can live of themselves, and are not forced
by poverty to serve others. In the <i>Byar</i> called <i>Aosahla</i> there are about 30 of
these <i>Clans</i>, or families, in others more or less according as they are in bigness,
which all have their several names, tho ’tis not worth while to repeat
them. And thus much shall suffice of the third division of <i>Lapland</i>, not lately
made (except that under <i>Charles IX</i> some <i>Clans</i> had certain allotments assign’d
them) but derived from very ancient time; as appears from hence that neither
the <i>Laplanders</i> have known, nor the <i>Swedes</i> given them any other, since the
Country hath bin under their subjection. Nor are the words modern, or taken
from any thing that may give any cause to suspect them of novelty: which I the
rather observe, that from hence the native simplicity, agreable to the antiquity
of the Nation, may appear.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the</i> Laplanders <i>in reference to the inclinations,
temper and habit, of their minds and bodies</i>.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">It is almost peculiar to this People to be all of them of low stature, which
is attested by the general suffrage of those Writers who have described this
Country. Hence the learned <i>Isaac Vossius</i> observes, that <i>Pygmies</i> are said to
inhabit here; and adds that they are a deformed People: but in truth their
feature and proportion is good enough, and that they are not distorted sufficiently
appears from their great agility of body, and fitness for active emploiment.
Nor need we dispute of this, since in <i>Sweden</i>, we see them every day
among us, and can observe no defect in any kind, or deformity, by <i>Lomenius</i>
unjustly ascribed to them. <i>Ol. Mag.</i> and <i>Tornæus</i> esteem their young women indifferently
handsome, and of a clear skin, which I have often seen my self;
for they take great care to preserve their natural beauty, which the men neglect
to do: and therefore if they are less amiable then the other Sex, it is to
be imputed to their choice, not nature. To which we may add the length of
their frosts, and the bitterness of the Air, against which they neither arm
themselves sufficiently with clothes, nor know how to do so: besides the smoak
which continually fills their cottages empairs very much their natural complexion,
which is the reason why most of the men also are so swarthy. And as they
are generally short, they are also very lean, and ’tis rare to see a fat man
amongst them, for the cold that prevents their growing tall, dries up likewise
their moisture, and makes them apt to be slender. They are also very light
in respect of their bulk and stature, which comes from their not eating any Salt,
if we will believe <i>Ol. Petr.</i> And thus much may be said in general of the frame
and condition of their bodies. As for their particular parts they have thick
heads, prominent foreheads, hollow and blear eyes, short flat noses, and wide
mouths. Their hair is thin, short and flaggy, their beard stragling, and
scarce covers their chins. The hair of both Sexes is generally black and hard,
very seldom yellow, their breasts broad, slender wasts, spindle shanks, and
swift of foot. They are very strong in their limbs, so that in a bow which a
<i>Norwegian</i> can scarce half bend, they will draw an arrow up to the head. Their
strength is accompanied with such activity withall, that with their bows and
quivers at their backs they will throw themselves thro a hoop of but a cubit in
diameter. But this seems to be spoken only of some Tumblers, for the People
are generally ignorant of such sports; their usual exercises being running
races, climbing inaccessible rocks and high trees. Tho they are thus nimble
and strong, yet they never go upright, but stooping, which habit they get
by frequent fitting in their cottages on the ground.</p>

<p>We come now to the habits of their mind, in which ’tis first observable
that they are much given to superstition, which is no wonder while they live
in Woods among wild Beasts, and maintain little correspondence one with another:
but of their superstition we shall treat elswhere. Furthermore they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
beyond all imagination fearfull and mean spirited, being frighted at the very
sight of a strange man, or ship; above all things dreading War: the reason
of all this being the cold to which they are condemn’d, and the meanness
of their diet, which cannot supply good blood and spirits; wherefore they
are useless in war, and the <i>Swedes</i> who raise men in all the other Provinces,
find none in this, as it appears from the ancient Records and Catalogues of
all the Souldiers that ever were listed by former Kings. So that ’tis fictitious,
and rather an abuse than history, which some have reported, that <i>Gust.
Adolphus</i> had several Companies of <i>Laplanders</i> in his Armies; but they were
forc’t to find out some excuse for those many defeats, which to the wonder
of the World that most victorious Prince gave his powerfull and numerous
Enemies; and pretend that those Victories were obtained by the help of the
<i>Laplanders</i> and Magic. Wherefore I conclude as I said before, that this opinion
is absurd and contradictory, not only to the nature of the People, but to public
testimonies and writings. To which we may add that they cannot well live out
of their own Country, but fall into diseases and die, being no more able
to endure a milder air, or feed upon salt, bread, and boiled meats, than
we could upon their raw flesh and fish dried by the Sun: for it has bin often
found by experience that they are hardly temted by any reward to come
even into these parts, or if they do they die suddenly afterwards, much
less would they be induced to march into any more remote Countries. <i>Olaus
Magnus</i> gives us an instance of six <i>Rain-deers</i> sent to <i>Frederick</i> Duke of <i>Holsatia</i>
by <i>Steno Sture</i> junior Prince of <i>Swedland</i>, with two <i>Laplanders</i>, a man
and woman to be their keepers, and that both they and the beasts wanting
their accustom’d manner of living, died all together in a short time. <i>Ziegler</i>
indeed on the other side saies they are a valiant People, and that they were
a long time free, resisting the Arms both of <i>Norway</i> and <i>Swedland</i>; and <i>Scaliger</i>
after him saies that against their enemies they were couragious: and
<i>Petr. Claud.</i> reports they had a King of their own called <i>Motle</i>, and that
<i>Haraldus Pulcricomus</i>, tho he had conquered the Countries round about,
could not subdue them; but all this doth not evince their courage: for whatsoever
is said of this Prince <i>Motle</i> is nothing at all to the purpose, being all
taken out of the history of <i>Snorro</i>, which speaking of <i>Motle</i>, and something
of his skill in Magick, has not a word of his or his Peoples courage. And
’tis manifest that <i>Ziegler</i> could have no ground for what he said, unless
from such histories as that of <i>Snorro</i>, which therefore only seem’d true because
there were none extant more likely; for in his time the <i>Laplanders</i> were
subject to the <i>Swedes</i>: unless we had rather believe that he took the <i>Laplanders</i>
and the <i>Biarmians</i> to be the same, ascribing to the one People, what was said
of the other. There is indeed mention in <i>Saxo</i>, of severall Wars of the <i>Biarmians</i>,
but those not managed by courage, but Magick and Enchantments: so
that it no way follows, that because they continued for many Ages a free
People, that therefore they were valiant. But whatever becomes of the <i>Biarmians</i>,
’tis sure enough that the <i>Laplanders</i> are far from being stout or warlike,
who must first fight against their nature, before they can resist an enemy.
Besides their innate cowardise, they are strangely prone to suspicion and
jealousy, being conscious of their own weakness, and so exposed to all attemts
upon them: a consequent whereof is that they are also revengefull; endeavouring
to prevent those mischeifs which upon the slightest occasions seem
to threaten them, by the death and ruine of the Persons that caused their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
suspicion, helping themselves herein, by conjuration and magick. Of this <i>Pet.
Claud.</i> gives us a memorable instance, in one, that having attemted to mischeif
his enemy, who was secured by countercharms, after long attendance surpriz’d
him asleep under a great stone, which by a spell he made break to
pieces, and kill him. The women, especially when grown old, cannot brook
any suddain provocation, but upon the least indignity offered fly out into
passion, and are hurried to the most wild transports that madness can dictate.
The <i>Laplanders</i> besides are very notorious cheats, and industrious to
over-reach each other in bargaining: tho heretofore they had the reputation
of plain dealing and honesty. So that ’tis probable that they took up their
present practice, having bin first cheated by those Strangers with whom they
dealt, and now think it best to be before hand with one another. It is farther
observable that they take great plesure, if they happen to outwit any
one; imagining that tho they are hopeless to overcome by manhood and courage,
they have a nobler triumph over the minds of those whom they circumvent.
They are also noted to be of a censorious and detracting humor, so
as to make it a chief ingredient of their familiar converse, to reproch and
despise others: and this they do especially to Strangers, of what Country
soever. So fond admirers are all men of themselves, that even the <i>Laplanders</i>
will not exchange their interests with the Inhabitants of the most happy
Climate, and however barbarous they are, doubt not to prefer themselves
in point of wisdom, to those that are most ingenuously educated in Arts and
Letters. They are likewise exceedingly covetous, it being a part of their
cowardize to dread poverty; yet are they very lazy withall: and hereupon
<i>Olaus Peters</i> observes, that tho their Country in several parts of it be capable
of emprovement by husbandry, yet ’tis suffer’d to lye wast: nay so unwilling
are they to take pains, that till they are compelled by necessity, they
hardly perswade themselves to hunt or fish. From this their covetousness and
sloth arises an ill consequent, their undutifulness to their Parents when
grown old; not only to contemn and neglect, but even hate and abhor them;
thinking it either long before they possess what they have, or thinking it
grievous to provide for those from whom they can hope for no advantage.</p>

<p>Their last good quality is their immoderate lust, which <i>Herberstein</i> takes
to be the more strange, considering their diet, that they have neither bread
nor salt, nor any other incentive of gluttony: but their promiscuous and continual
lying together in the same Hut, without any difference of age, sex,
or condition, seems to occasion this effect. <i>Tornæus</i> indeed saies of his Country-men,
the <i>Lappi Tornenses</i>, who possibly are reclaimed by more civill education,
that they are very chast, insomuch that among them scarce one bastard
is Christned in a whole year, which is the less to be wonder’d at, the
women being naturally barren.</p>

<p>Having given this account of the <i>Laplanders</i> ill qualities, it will now be
justice to recount their vertues, as first their veneration and due esteem of
Marriage, which they more seldom violate, then many who pretend to be
much better Christians. They also abhor theft; so that the Merchants only
cover their goods so as to secure them against the weather, when they have
occasion to leave them, and at their return are sure to find them safe, and untoucht;
which is the more commendable, for that in <i>Lapland</i> there are no
Towns, or store-houses, and no man could be sure of any thing, if the
People were inclined to thievery. They are likewise (those I mean of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
better sort) charitable to the poor, not only by receiving those that are destitute
into their Huts; but supplying them with stock whereon to live. In
proof of this <i>Tornæus</i> and <i>Sam. Rheen</i>, say that ’tis usual with them to lend
<i>gratis</i>, for a considerable time, ten or twenty Rain-deers. Farther they are
civil and hospitable to Strangers, whom they with much kindness invite to
their Huts, and there treat with the best provisions they have. And of this
there are severall instances, when any have happened to be cast upon their
Coast by shipwrack, or else in the snow, or on the mountains have lost their
way. Moreover they are thus far cleanly as often to wash their hands and face;
tho notwithstanding <i>Tornæus</i> tells us, they are nasty and scabby, and
use not to comb their heads. Lastly they are sufficiently ingenious, making
for themselves all sorts of tools and implements for their fishing and hunting;
and also for severall manufactures, some of which they do very artificially,
as shall be shewn hereafter in its proper place.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Originall of the</i> Laplanders.</span></h2>

</div>
<p class="noindent">We have intimated our conjecture concerning the originall of the
<i>Laps</i>, and more then that it will be hard to produce, there being no
sober history which gives testimony in this affair. Negatively we may pass
sentence, and conclude they were not <i>Swedes</i>, no People differing more
both in constitution of body and mind, in language and habit, or whatever
else is taken for a character of likeness, or having the same originall. Neither
can any one think that they were ever <i>Russians</i> or <i>Moscovites</i>; seeing they
differ as much from them, as from the <i>Swedes</i>. The <i>Russians</i> are generally tall,
the <i>Laplanders</i> on the contrary very short; those are fat and corpulent, these
lean and slender; those have thick hair, long beards, and good complexions,
these wear their hair short and thin, and are dark and swarthy. But most of
all the language is different, in which the <i>Laps</i> and <i>Russes</i> have in a manner
no kind of agreement. They must then come from their Neighbours,
either the <i>Norwegians</i> on the one side, or the <i>Finlanders</i> upon the other.
But they could not well be derived from <i>Norway</i>, who are known to have
drawn their originall from the <i>Swedes</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<img src="images/zill_t016.jpg" width="350" height="800" alt="Laplander holding spear" />
</a>
</div>

<p>It remains therefore that they came from the <i>Finlanders</i>, who have a
certain division or allotment called <i>Lappio</i>. But tho we have shewed that
the name and originall of this Nation is not taken thence, it is not to be
doubted that they are of the race of the <i>Finlanders</i> and <i>Samojedes</i>, and
this is the opinion of most learned men, which may be farther proved by
many arguments. First the name of both Nations is the same, the <i>Laplanders</i>
in their own language being called <i>Sabmi</i> or <i>Same</i>, and the <i>Finlanders</i>
<i>Suoni</i>, which two differ only in the Dialect; and there is a tradition that
they had both the same Founder <i>Jumi</i>, who could not well have bin the Author
of diverse Nations. We may also observe that their languages have
much affinity, tho they be not the very same, as shall be proved at large in
a particular Chapter. The <i>Finlanders</i> call <i>God</i>, <i>Jumala</i>, the <i>Laplanders</i>, <i>Jubmal</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the <i>Finlanders</i> fire, <i>Tuli</i>, the <i>Laplanders</i> <i>Tolle</i>; they call a hill <i>Wuori</i>, these
<i>Warra</i>, and so they agree in many other words. Besides they have bodies
and habits alike, both their limbs well set, black hair, broad faces, and stern
countenances, and whatever else they have different is very small, or may
easily proceed from their diet or Clime, in which they live. Their clothes
too are not much unlike; for if we compare the Picture of an ancient <i>Finlander</i>,
as it still remains in
the Church of <i>Storekyr</i> in
<i>Ostrobothnia</i>, where the slaughter
of Bishop <i>Henry</i> was
drawn at large, with mine of
a <i>Laplander</i> in Chapt. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVII</span>.
it will appear there is no
great difference between
them. Lastly they agree in
disposition and humor: they
are both much given to laziness
at home, unless when
necessity urges them to work;
both, unmoveable from their
purpose, both superstitious
and lovers of Magick. And
therefore <i>Ol. Magn.</i> saies of
them both, that they were
so skilfull Magicians in the
time of their Paganism as if
they had had <i>Zoroaster</i> himself
for their teacher. In a word
whatever <i>Tacitus</i> saies of the
<i>Finlanders</i>, now holds true
of the <i>Laplanders</i>, that <i>they
have neither weapons, horses,
nor houshold gods, they live
upon herbs, are cloth’d with
skins, lie upon the ground,
putting all their confidence in
arrows, which they head with
bones for want of iron. Both
the men and women support
themselves by hunting, and they
have no other defence for their
Children against the violence
of wild beasts or weather, but
Huts or hurdles, which are the
security of the old men as well
as young.</i> And the same Description
which <i>Saxo</i> gives of
these, belongs as well to the
<i>Laplanders</i>, that <i>they are the farthest People towards the North, living in a
Clime almost inhabitable, good archers and hunters, wanderers, and of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
uncertain habitations, wheresoever they kill a beast making that their mansion, and
they slide upon the snow in broad wooden shoes</i>. Besides all this, the <i>Norwegians</i>
and <i>Danes</i> call the <i>Laplanders</i>, <i>Fenni</i>, as may be seen in <i>Petr. Claud.</i> where
he divides the <i>Finlanders</i> into <i>Siofinnar</i>, i. e. maritime <i>Finlanders</i>, and
<i>Lappefinner</i>; i. e. <i>Lappfinlanders</i>, the same with the <i>Laplanders</i>. This
may be collected too from the <i>Russians</i> calling them not only <i>Lappi</i>, but <i>Kajienni</i>,
the original of which name can be no other but that they esteem them
to be the <i>Cajani</i>, of which name there is a Province now in <i>Finland</i> called
<i>Cajania</i> the great.</p>

<p>But here some imagine that the <i>Laplanders</i> came not in probability from
the <i>Finlanders</i>, because the one are very warlike, the other cowards, these
fat and corpulent, those lean and meager. But this doth not at all invalidate
our arguments; for every one knows that diet will much alter the
habit of the body, and the <i>Finlanders</i> have plenty of good nurishing meats,
of which the <i>Laplanders</i> are quite destitute. And for the <i>Finlanders</i> courage
in war, heretofore they were not so notable for it, for <i>Tacitus</i> saies <i>they
had neither arms nor horses</i>, by which he implies they knew not at all what
belonged to war. Neither are they very expert at it yet, for by daily experience
’tis found when they are likely to be prest for Soldiers they hide
themselves, and by all means decline employment, therefore they are not
warlike from their nature, but from their discipline and arts, and in their
natural temper they differ not much from the <i>Laplanders</i>. But what need
we go about to prove this by so many arguments, when they confess themselves
they are originally sprung from the <i>Finlanders</i>, and still keep a list
of the Captains that first led them forth into <i>Lapland</i>, of whom <i>Mieschogiesch</i>
is the chief. The same is confirm’d by <i>Andr. Andresonius</i> who lived
there, and learn’t it from them, only that he said <i>Thins kogreh</i> was the
cheif Captain, and so doth <i>Zachar. Plantin</i>. But whatever is said of either
of these two Captains, we are not to imagine that they brought the first
Plantation of <i>Laplanders</i> into this Country, for ’tis not probable they
should so long remember their names, who must have lived before <i>Saxo</i>,
for he mentions this Country, and lived about 480 years before us, at which
time the <i>Finlanders</i> themselves scarce know what was done, much less the
<i>Laplanders</i>. And this the name <i>Thinns</i>, doth something prove, which none
shall perswade me to be an old <i>Finland</i> word, for it is the same with the <i>Swedes</i>
<i>Thinnis</i>, and the Dutch <i>Thinius</i>, i. e. <i>Antonius</i>, and that the word <i>Antonius</i>
was known to the <i>Finlanders</i> before <i>Christ</i> no man will suspect. The
same may be said concerning the pretended occasion of the Colony of <i>Finlanders</i>
setling in <i>Lapland</i>; for they themselves say, that they left <i>Brokarla</i>
and <i>Rengoarvis</i>, because they were opprest with taxes and pitcht first
in a wood in <i>Ostrobothnia</i> called <i>Tavastia</i> near the <i>Bodic bay</i>. But all this, as
hath bin shew’d the very name of <i>Lappi</i>, which signifies banish’t persons, sufficiently
confutes. <i>Plantin</i> and <i>Peter Nieuren</i>, pretend that though the <i>Laplanders</i>
voluntarily removed to <i>Tavastia</i>, they were forc’t to their present
habitation: for the Natives of <i>Tavastia</i>, griev’d to see them in a florishing
condition, wearing rich clothes, fareing deliciously, and abounding in all manner
of wealth, chose them a Captain called <i>Matthias Kurk</i>, and with a great
number invaded their quarters, killing and plundering all they met with, not
desisting till they had quite drove them as far as the Rivers <i>Kimi</i> and <i>Torne</i>:
and not long after perceiving they lived too happily there, they set upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
them the second time, dealing so cruelly with them, that leaving their Cattel
they were forc’t to fly into those barren Countries they now inhabit, carrying
with them only their nets. <i>Plantin.</i> adds further that <i>Andr. Andresonius</i> affirms
he saw some ancient letters, in which mention was made of <i>Kurk</i> a Governour
of the <i>Laplanders</i>: but as for his other name of <i>Matthias</i>, it is plain it was
postnate to Christianity, since which time if we should imagine the <i>Laplanders</i>
first to have come into these parts, we must also suppose the Country to have
bin till then uninhabited, whereas we have all reason to believe that the <i>Biarmi</i>
and <i>Scridfinni</i> lived here before <i>Christ</i>, the latter of which seem by their
name to have bin only a Colony sent out of <i>Finland</i>: and mention is made
of <i>Finlanders</i> in these parts in the time of <i>Harald</i> the fair, or <i>Harfager</i> King
of <i>Norway</i>, and his Son <i>Ericus Bodsexe</i>, who lived long before the times of
Christianity, and went down into <i>Finmark</i> and <i>Biarmia</i>, and obtained a
great victory over them. Now if he went by Sea Northwards of <i>Norway</i> to
come to <i>Finmark</i>, <i>Finmark</i> then must have bin near <i>Norway</i>, as lying North
of it near the Sea, that is the same Country that is now named <i>Finmark</i>,
which because then inhabited by <i>Finlanders</i>, as appears by the name, it is
not to be believed that it was first possess’t by the <i>Laplanders</i> that were drove
out of <i>South-Bothnia</i> by <i>Matthias Kurk</i>. Neither are they called <i>Lappi</i> from
being driven out then, for they were so called in <i>Saxo</i>’s time, and there is
little reason to believe that <i>Matthias Kurk</i>’s expedition was before him, especially
from that inscription which mentions <i>Kurk</i>, since that in those times
they knew not so much of writing as to record any thing in it.</p>

<p>Wherefore we must find out some better authority to confirm to us the
originall of the <i>Lapps</i>, for we may believe that the <i>Finlanders</i> more then
once march’t out into <i>Lapland</i>, which is evident from the several names of
their leaders, whom some called <i>Thinns-Kogre</i>, others <i>Mieschogiesche</i>. The first
and most ancient is that from whence the <i>Biarmi</i> took their originall, whom
I conclude to have descended from the <i>Finlanders</i>, from calling their Gods
by <i>Finlandish</i> names. Besides in their nature and manners they agree with
the ancient <i>Finlanders</i>: and lastly are called by all Strangers <i>Scridfinni</i>, i. e.
<i>Finlanders</i> going upon frozen snow, which, the ancient knowing none else to
go so, took to be the <i>Biarmi</i>. But the name of <i>Biarmi</i> was given them
by the <i>Finlanders</i> from their going to dwell upon the Mountains, from the
word <i>Varama</i>, which signifies a hilly Country: now because Strangers knew
from the <i>Swedes</i> they used wooden shoes to go upon the snow, which by the
<i>Swedes</i> are called <i>Att Skriida</i>, not knowing the name <i>Biarmi</i>, they called
them <i>Scridfinni</i>: and because the <i>Finlanders</i> and <i>Biarmians</i> were of the same
originall, they were often subject to the same Prince, as to <i>Cuso</i> in King
<i>Holters</i> time. What the occasion was of this leaving their Country is yet
doubtfull, except it was for fear of the <i>Swedes</i>, who in the reign of King
<i>Agnus</i> invaded <i>Froste</i> King of <i>Finland</i>, and harassed the whole Country.
The second time of deserting their Country was when the <i>Russians</i> enlarged
their Empire as far as the lake <i>Ladog</i>. For fearing the cruelty of
these People they retired into <i>Lapland</i>: which I am apt to beleive because
the <i>Russians</i> call them <i>Kienni</i>, as has bin said before from their passage through
<i>Kajania</i> into <i>Lapland</i>, which they could not have known but by their own
experience; and their wars with them, especially those of <i>Carelia</i> and <i>Cajania</i>
being so ignorant both in history and other Countries, that they scarce know
any thing of their own, that is of any antiquity. And this proves what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
have said of their second leaving their Country, which was about the 6<sup>th</sup> age after
<i>Christ</i>: and these perhaps are they which are simply called <i>Finni</i> by the <i>Danes</i>,
<i>Swedes</i>, and <i>Norwegians</i>, or with the addition of <i>Siæ</i> or <i>Field</i>, obsolete words
of the <i>Biarmians</i>, because they were more then they in number, especially
after <i>Harald Harfiger</i> King of <i>Norway</i>, who almost destroyed all the <i>Biarmi</i>
in battle. In the mean while the <i>Finlanders</i> lay secure in <i>Finmark</i>, and all
the <i>Biarmi</i> being extinct, the name of <i>Finni</i> obtained, and the name and
credit of the <i>Biarmi</i> was quite abolish’t and forgot. And these are all the
times they left their Country before they were called <i>Lappi</i>, for till after
this they were never called otherwise than <i>Finni</i>, <i>Scritofinni</i>, and <i>Biarmi</i>.
But in after ages we find them named <i>Lappones</i>, of whom <i>Adam. Bremensis</i>
makes no mention who lived in 1077, but <i>Saxo</i> doth, that lived in 1200;
and therefore ’tis probable that in that intervall of time, after they were call’d
<i>Lappones</i>, they made their third migration. But any one that will examine the
histories of that time, will scarce find any thing that should move the <i>Finlanders</i>
to leave their Country, as <i>Ericus Sanctus</i> hath made it appear in that
Expedition in which he brought them under the <i>Swedish</i> Government, and
planted among them the Christian Religion, which he made in the year 1150,
when no small number of them the third time seem to have deserted their
Country, and gone into <i>Lapland</i>. And the reason is plain, having bin subject’d
to Strangers, and forc’t to be of a Religion different from that of their Ancestors,
which thereupon was hatefull to them, and therefore no wonder some of
them sought out a place where they might live free: which is as good a reason
too why they were called <i>Lapps</i> by those that stayed, for they submitting to
the <i>Swedes</i>, and embracing Christianity, look’t upon them as desertors of their
Country, whom fear only of a good Government, and better Religion, had
made exiles, especially when the King had put forth an Edict that all should
be accounted banish’t that would not renounce Pagan Superstition; therefore
they were justly called <i>Lappi</i>, and care not to hear of the name to this day.</p>

<p>And this is my opinion of their originall and migrations, out of which I
shall not be perswaded by those learned men who believe they rather came
from the <i>Tartars</i>, for we never read of any of them going into the North.
Moreover the <i>Tartars</i> live altogether by war and plunder, whereas the <i>Laplanders</i>
live by hunting and grasing, abhorring nothing more than war. Besides
the cheif delight of the <i>Tartars</i> is in having many stately Horses, of which
the <i>Lapps</i> are so ignorant, that in their whole language they have not a word to
signify an Horse: the language also of the two Nations is so different that one
cannot possibly be derived from the other. And altho some learned men, who
pretend they understood both languages of <i>Finland</i> and <i>Lapland</i>, confidently
aver that they are altogether diverse: yet it will be easy to produce diverse
men as well skill’d in them, as they that say the contrary. Besides ’tis no consequence
because there are a few differences between the <i>Finland</i> and <i>Lapland</i>
languages, that they are therefore utterly diverse, when this disagreeing may
rather proceed from the length of time than any diversity of the Tongues at
first, as we find now many <i>Swedish</i> words that do not at all agree with those
now in vogue, which yet do not constitute a new language. And their saying
the <i>Laplanders</i> could not come from the <i>Finlanders</i>, because they alwaies
hated one another, is of little force, when the reasons of their hatred are
enough explained already. But it signifies less that the <i>Finlanders</i> have severall
Customs and Manners not in use among the <i>Laplanders</i>, as the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
building houses, <i>&amp;c.</i> for these were to accommodate themselves to the nature
of the place whither they came, and to forget those things which would not
be of any use to them. And moreover, there remains still a memoriall of
those that came out of <i>Finland</i>, where they first sate down in the woods of
<i>Tavastia</i>, near a Lake which they call <i>Lappiakairo</i>, that is the Fountain of
the <i>Laplanders</i>, who when their necessary food grew scarce, went further up
into the Desarts, and the <i>Finlanders</i> pursuing them in <i>Tavastia</i>, they retreat’d
to the <i>Bothnic</i> bay, where they might be more safe, and have more conveniences
for living: and this is that migration yet in memory which <i>Plantin.</i>
speaks of, <i>viz.</i> that the <i>Laplanders</i> lived here for an age, or more, till the
time of King <i>Magn. Ladulaos</i>, An. 1272, who to get them under his subjection,
promised any one that could effect it, the Government of them, which the <i>Birkarli</i>,
<i>i. e.</i> those that lived in the allotment or division of <i>Birkala</i>, undertook;
and having for a great while cunningly insinuated themselves into them, under
a pretence of friendship, at last set upon them unawares, and quite subdued
them. But before this they were infested by the <i>Tavasti</i> under the command
of <i>Kurk</i>, which if we would strictly examine, we should find it of later date
than about Christs time, contrary to some mens opinions. As it happens in
things that are taken upon trust, the <i>Laplanders</i> confound the more modern
with the ancient, making but one history of all that happen’d in the distinct
times of <i>Ericus Sanctus</i>, <i>Magnus Ladulaos</i>, with some other Kings before and
after, and that so confused and lame, that it is hard for any one to understand
it. <i>Ol. Petr.</i> mentions at large one <i>Matthias</i>, Captain of the <i>Finlanders</i>, when
they subdued and drove out the <i>Laplanders</i> into the furthest and most desolate
place of the North, whom some think to be a noble Family of the <i>Kurks</i>
in <i>Finland</i>, and that he ceased not, by frequent inrodes upon them, to molest
them, till they promised to pay him yearly tribute, which he at length
weary of the long and tedious journey exchanged with some of <i>Birkarla</i> in
<i>Tavastia</i> for a part of <i>Finland</i>, whence followed what is most true, that the
<i>Laplanders</i> to the year 1554 paid annuall tribute to the <i>Birkarli</i>, besides
whom it was not lawfull for any others to trade with them. There are those
now living who say they have seen the letters and conditions of the <i>Kurks</i>
kept in <i>Ersnees</i>, an allotment of <i>Lulalapmark</i>, by one <i>Jo. Nilson</i>. Which
things are so far from being immediatly after the birth of <i>Christ</i>, that they may
be reasonably thought to have bin since <i>Mag. Ladulaos</i>, unless we can imagine
that <i>Ol. Petr.</i> by his <i>Tavasti</i> and <i>Buræus</i> by <i>Birkarli</i> meant the same people,
since there were other <i>Birkarli</i> inhabitants of <i>Tavastia</i>, who chose them a
Captain named <i>Kurk</i>, under whom they drove out the <i>Laplanders</i> out of
the Borders of the Eastern <i>Bothnia</i>, and made them tributary, and the letters
may not be ascribed to <i>Kurk</i>, but to <i>Ladulaos</i>, in which he had granted
the <i>Birkarli</i> the priviledge to receive tribute of the <i>Lapps</i>, and of trafficking
with them, for it is not probable that <i>Kurk</i>, though he was their chosen Captain,
was to have all the benefit of the <i>Laplanders</i> to himself, so as by contract
to tranfer to the <i>Birkarli</i> his right. For the <i>Tavastii</i> were either a free People
and so shared among one another whatever they got, or else under some
Prince, and so could not give another what was not their own, but their
Masters. Besides if they did give <i>Kurk</i> any thing, as some Villages, or the
like, it was not from any bargain that they were to receive in its stead tribute
from the <i>Laplanders</i>, but as a reward to himself for his pains and conduct
in the war. But whatever may be said of <i>Kurk</i> and the <i>Tavasti</i>, ’tis certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the <i>Laplanders</i> never came originally from the <i>Russians</i>, nor as others think
from the <i>Tartars</i>, but from the <i>Finlanders</i>, having bin driven out of their
Country, and forc’t to change their habitations often, till at length they
fixt in this Land where they now live: and that Country, which from the
remove of its inhabitants was called <i>Lapland</i>, had the same name continued
by the <i>Swedes</i>, who had conquered the greatest part thereof. For after the
<i>Swedes</i> had learnt from the <i>Finlanders</i> that they were called <i>Lapps</i>, they also
gave them the same name, then the <i>Danes</i> took it up: then <i>Saxo</i>, afterwards
<i>Ziegler</i>, then <i>Dam. Goes</i>, who had the account which he gives of the <i>Laplanders</i>
from <i>Ol.</i> and <i>Joh. Magn.</i> and so at last all the Country was called
<i>Lapland</i> from the Bay of <i>Bothnia</i> Northwards, especially after it was made
subject to the <i>Swedes</i>, except only that part which lies on the Coasts of <i>Norway</i>,
which retained its antient name of <i>Finland</i>; as also that part towards
the white Sea, called by the <i>Moscovites</i>, <i>Cajanica</i>, altho these sometimes
call the inhabitants <i>Loppi</i>, which without doubt they took from their neighbours
the <i>Finlanders</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Religion of the</i> Laplanders.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Having seen the rise and Original of the <i>Laplanders</i>, we come now
to speak more distinctly of them, but first of their Religion; not only
what is now, but also what was before Christianity came to be receiv’d there.
For there were <i>Laplanders</i>, or at least some Inhabitants of <i>Lapland</i> before
the Christian Religion was introduced: such as the <i>Finni</i>, <i>Lappofinni</i>, <i>Scridfinni</i>,
or <i>Biarmi</i>, as is above said; but it was very long before the <i>Laplanders</i>
properly so called embraced the Christian Religion. At first there is no
doubt they were Pagans, as all the Northern Nations were, but being all
Pagans were not of the same Religion, it may be enquired which the <i>Laplanders</i>
profest. And I suppose it could be no other then that of the <i>Finlanders</i>,
from whom they derive their original, and consequently their Religion
too. But what the Religion of the <i>Finlanders</i> was is very uncertain,
since we have no account of the ancient affairs of that Nation. Therefore
we must make our conjectures from the <i>Biarmi</i>, and <i>Scridfinni</i>, as also from
some remains among the <i>Finlanders</i> and <i>Laplanders</i>.</p>

<p>We have already prov’d the <i>Biarmi</i> to be the first Colony that the <i>Finlanders</i>
sent into <i>Lapland</i>, of whom this is chiefly recorded in ancient Monuments,
that they worship’d a certain God whom they called <i>Jumala</i>: which
<i>Jumala</i> or <i>Jomala</i> is manifestly a different word from what is mentioned
in the History of <i>St. Olaus</i> King of <i>Norway</i>, and of <i>Herrodus</i>, for they
relate it as peculiar to the <i>Biarmi</i>, and unknown to themselves; who being
either <i>Goths</i>, <i>Norwegians</i> or <i>Islanders</i>, it cannot possibly be any old <i>Gothic</i>
word, but of some other Country, and therefore most probably of <i>Finland</i>,
where it is now in use. For <i>God</i>, which is by the <i>Swedes</i>, <i>Goths</i>, and
all of the same original termed <i>Gott</i>, or <i>Gudh</i>, is by them called <i>Jumala</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
custom without doubt prevailing that the same name, whereby in ancient
times they called the false God, was translated to the true One, both by the
<i>Finlanders</i>, the <i>Biarmi</i> and the <i>Laplanders</i> also who came out of <i>Finland</i>,
and being joined with the <i>Biarmi</i> made one Nation. Besides <i>Jumala</i>, it
seems the <i>Laplanders</i> had a God whom the <i>Swedes</i> call <i>Thor</i>, which may be
gathered, not only because they worship one <i>Thor</i> at this present among
their idols, as shall be shewn hereafter, but also because in the number
of Gods which the old <i>Finlanders</i>, especially the <i>Tavasti</i> adored, there was
reckoned <i>Turrisas</i>, the God of War and Victory, which was no other then
<i>Thor</i>. This <i>Turrisas</i> is put in one word for <i>Turris-As</i> (i. e.) <i>Turris</i>, <i>Turrus</i>,
or <i>Torus</i> (for so his name is diversly written) the Prince of the <i>Ases</i>, or
<i>Asiatics</i>, for those who in former times came out of <i>Asia</i> into these parts were
called <i>Ases</i>, of whom this <i>Turrus</i> was the first, who from that time was worshipped
by the <i>Finlanders</i> by the name of <i>Turrisas</i>; which may farther be
proved from <i>Arngrinus Jonæ</i>, who saies the first King of the <i>Finlanders</i> was
<i>Torrus</i>, one of the Predecessors of King <i>Norus</i>, from whom some think
<i>Norige</i>, (i. e.) <i>Norway</i>, quasi <i>Nori Rige</i>, to take its denomination, it being
frequent for the ancient Kings to take upon them the names of their Gods.
Thus among the ancient <i>Greeks</i> we find many who were called by the names
of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Neptune</i>. So <i>Torrus</i> the King was so called from <i>Torus</i> the
ancient God of the <i>Finlanders</i>, from whom without doubt he was derived
to the <i>Laplanders</i>, together with their language, worships, and other
customs. To these two (if they are two) <i>Jumala</i> and <i>Thor</i>, may be added
the <i>Sun</i>, which I gather from this, because he is still reckoned among their
Gods. Besides he is generally worship’d in all barbarous and pagan Countries,
and if he be adored for his light and heat by those People, who enjoy the
benefit of a warm air and temperate climate, how much more by the <i>Laplanders</i>,
who for no small space endure the hardship of continual night and
bitter frosts? but I shall speak more concerning the Sun hereafter.</p>

<p>These are the chief Gods of the <i>Laplanders</i>, whether they had any of less
note may be questioned, tho I doubt it not; because at this day they worship
some others, which the <i>Finlanders</i> did before them, and probably
brought with them into <i>Lapland</i>. Of these the <i>Carelii</i> had <i>Rongotheus</i> the
God of Ry, <i>Pellonpeko</i> of Barly, <i>Wierecannos</i> of Oats, <i>Egres</i> of Herbs, Pease,
Turnips, Flax, and Hemp; <i>Uko</i> with his wife <i>Rowne</i>, of tempests; <i>Kækre</i>
the Protector of Cattel from wild beasts; <i>Hyse</i> had the command of <i>Wolves</i>,
and Bears, <i>Nyrke</i> of Squirrel-hunting, <i>Hyttavanes</i> of Hare-hunting. Some
of these the <i>Laplanders</i> worshipped; especially those whose help they stood
chiefly in need of to the performing of their business, as the gods of hunting
and preserving their Cattel from wild beasts, and such like: others probably
they neglected as useless, because they neither plowed nor sowed. But
I cannot say under what names they worshipped them, because I find nothing
of certainty thereof, either in their ancient records, or modern customs.</p>

<p>Next we must consider what kind of worship they pai’d their Gods, which
we have already mentioned; but of this also we are in great uncertainty,
unless we make our judgment from the present times, and deliver those
rites which are now used by the <i>Laplanders</i> in their religious performances,
but of this we shall speak more when we come to treat of the present state
of their Religion. We shall only note here what is read of <i>Jumala</i>. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
heretofore represented in the image of a man sitting upon an Altar, with a
Crown on his head, adorned with twelve gems, and a golden Chain about
his neck, which was formerly of the value of 300 Marks; tho whether the word
in the History doth signify a chain, or may better be rendred a Jewel, ’tis
uncertain; for it is said that <i>Charles</i> lifting his Ax, cut the collar whereon
it hanged: which shews that it was rather gold, artificially carved and set with
jewels, which was (I suppose) the reason why <i>Herrodus</i> doth not set down
its weight, as is usual in the valuing of chains, but its price. This Jewel
called <i>Men</i> from <i>Mene</i> the Moon whose figure it represented, was, as I imagine,
tied to a collar about the neck, and hanged down upon the brest of the
image, as is usual in all such ornaments at this day. But whether this were
a chain or locket, it is certain the other parts of his habit were agreeable
to our description of him; wherein he was not much unlike the <i>Swedes</i> God
<i>Thor</i>, as he is described in our History of <i>Upsal</i>: for he also was made sitting
with a Crown on his head, adorned with stars, as <i>Jumala</i> with jewels, each
to the number of twelve, from whence I am almost perswaded that the
<i>Biarmi</i>, and after them the <i>Laplanders</i>, either worshipped one God under
two names, or if they were two Gods, they used their names promiscuously.
For the true God, whom they knew partly by reason, and partly by tradition,
was by them called <i>Jumala</i>: but after the name of <i>Thor</i> began to be
famous, they either called <i>Jumala</i> by the name of <i>Thor</i>, or gave <i>Thor</i> the
name of <i>Jumala</i>: which I gather from hence, because at this day the <i>Laplanders</i>
attribute that to their <i>Thor</i>, which questionless formerly they did to
<i>Jumala</i>, <i>viz.</i> the power and command over the inferior Gods, especially
the bad and hurtful: also over the air, thunder, lightning, health, life
and death of men, and such like; as shall be shewn hereafter. What his image
was made of, is not known, but I suppose it was wood, because <i>Charles</i> is
said to have cut off his head with his Ax, when he only designed the cutting
of the collar that held the aforesaid jewel, which he could hardly have don,
had it bin either silver or gold. Besides, to prove it was wood, it was burnt
to ashes, together with the Temple, and all its furniture, excepting some
gold, and other precious things; with which gold particularly they did homage
to their God: for the <i>Biarmi</i> in their ceremonies to <i>Jumala</i>, did cast
gold as a sacred offertory to him into a golden dish, of a vast weight and
bigness, which stood upon his knees. This Vessel, in the History of <i>Olaus</i>,
is said to be of silver, and full of silver coin, for a little before his time both
basin and gold were lost, and the <i>Biarmi</i>, never had an opportunity of getting
more. They did not worship <i>Jumala</i> every where, but in some few
places, or perhaps only in that one, where in a thick remote wood he had
a kind of a Temple, not as they are usually built with walls and roof, but
only a piece of ground fenced as the old Roman Temples were; from hence
one might look every way, which could not have bin don had they bin cover’d
at the top. As in the form of their Temples, so in the situation of them they
did imitate the ancients, who for the most part chose groves to worship their
Gods in, and there built their Temples. So much of <i>Jumala</i>, and the ancient
manner of worshipping him amongst the <i>Biarmi</i>, as it is transmitted
to us by ancient Writers; but of <i>Thor</i>, the Sun, and the other Gods, there
is nothing read but what belongs to the times of Christianity, and the superstition
still remaining amongst them, of which we shall speak particularly
in the following Chapter.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the second, or Christian Religion
of the</i> Laplanders.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><i>Lapland</i> among other Nations, after a long night of Paganism,
was enlightned with the Christian Religion: of which I shall now
speak. In the first place we must enquire how and when they first began to
hear’d of Christs name: but this will be very difficult, because all Writers
are silent herein. <i>Plantin</i> indeed affirms from their report, that they first
hear of the Christian Religion in the last age; from whence he concludes
that they came out of <i>Finland</i> before the <i>Finlanders</i> were converted. But
for all this we can hardly yield our assent to him; for it is certain on the
contrary that they knew, and some of them embraced, the Christian Religion
in the time of <i>Ziegler</i>, who lived in the very beginning of the precedent
age, and was present at the destruction of <i>Stockholm</i> by <i>Christiern</i> the Tyrant,
which he hath very well described: he affirms that they admited Christianity
to obtain the favor of their Kings, which cannot be spoken of
<i>Christiern</i>, or his immediate Predecessor, but of several others in former
ages. And indeed it is very improbable that so many Christian Kings should
take no care of propagating their Religion among the <i>Laplanders</i>, but permit
them to live in a heathenish impiety, without so much as ever hearing
the name of Christ; especially since there are Letters of <i>Ericus</i> King of
<i>Pomerania</i> extant, wherein he advises the Consistory of <i>Upsal</i> that they
would send Priests to instruct the <i>Laplanders</i>; which <i>Charles</i> the IX afterwards
made an argument of his title to <i>Lapland</i> against his neighbors. Besides
they had adjoining to them the <i>Birkarli</i>, who were either <i>Finlanders</i>
or <i>Swedes</i>, and were converted long before; with these they maintained a
commerce, and paid them tribute even from the time of <i>Ladulaus Magnus</i>,
who reign’d four ages ago. Therefore it is false what <i>Plantin</i> affirms of
their being converted in the last age; on the contrary I presume that from
the time of <i>Ladulaus</i>, there alwaies were some in <i>Lapland</i> who either were
Christians, or pretended to be so: for then their Country was subdued
and made a Province of <i>Swedland</i>, and it cannot be doubted but the <i>Swedes</i>
propagated the Christian Religion together with their dominion in <i>Lapland</i>.
Tho if our conjecture prove true of the <i>Laplanders</i> removing out of <i>Finland</i>,
by reason of the wars of <i>Ericus Sanctus</i>, and the planting of the Christian
Religion there, it will appear from thence that they heard of Christ, tho
they neglected him. However no prudent man can suppose that their neighbors
the <i>Finlanders</i> for so many ages should never mention any thing of the
Christian Religion to them. And therefore my opinion is the more confirmed
that the <i>Laplanders</i> had heard of Christ ever since <i>Ericus Sanctus</i>
his time, even these five ages, tho they rejected his Doctrine, as long as
they retained their own freedom: but after they became subject to the <i>Swedes</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
whether on their own accord to please their Kings, as <i>Ziegler</i> would have it,
or for other reasons, at length they took upon them the name of Christians,
which happened in the time of <i>Ladulaus Magnus</i>, in the year 1277, from
whence we must date the planting of Christian Religion in <i>Lapland</i>, which
Religion they neither wholy embraced, nor wholy refused, but retained it
with an inveterate, and as it were Jewish prejudice, not out of any zeal,
or preferring it as more necessary for their welfare before their former Religion;
but outwardly only and in shew, esteeming it the best means to gain
their Princes favor, and to prevent those evils which threatened them, if
they should persist in their obstinacy. Hence it was that they were married
by a Christian Priest, and baptised their children according to the ceremonies
of Christianity, which were the two chief things wherein their Christian
Religion consisted; and the only things mention’d by <i>Olaus M.</i> For the use
of catechising, or preaching of the Gospel, and other information in the
heads of Christian Religion were wholy unknown to them, as may be prov’d
from the ancient records of Bishopricks, wherein there is no mention of
any <i>Lapponian</i> Diocess, or Church, or of any Diocess to which <i>Lapland</i>
might belong. Lastly, if it had not bin so, what need was there of <i>Ericus</i>
his express to <i>Upsal</i>, that they would send Priests into <i>Lapland</i>? this, and
whatsoever else <i>Ziegler</i> alledges for the slow advance of Christianity in
<i>Lapland</i>, <i>Olaus Magnus</i> endevors to evade; but at length is forc’t to confess
that the Northern parts thereof are not yet reclaimed, and therefore
hopes for their conversion.</p>

<p>This was the State of Christianity in <i>Lapland</i> till the times of <i>Gustavus</i>,
differing from their ancient Paganism only in name, and a few external rites,
whereby they labored to make the World believe that they were Christians;
which gave <i>Damianus à Goes</i> (tho a friend and contemporary of <i>Johannes</i>
and <i>Olaus Magnus</i>) very good reason to complain that there was no knowledg
of God and Christ in the Land. From hence we may understand how to interpret
<i>Olaus M.</i> when he saies that by the earnest and pious exhortations
of the Catholic Priests, great part of these wild People were, and more
were likely to be brought over to the Christian Religion. But when <i>Gustavus</i>
came to the Crown, as he took greater care then his Predecessors for promoting
of the true Religion in other parts of his dominions, so he did in
<i>Lapland</i> also; and as the chief means to effect this, he took the peculiar
charge of them upon himself. Whereas heretofore they were rather tributaries
of the <i>Birkarli</i> then the Kings of <i>Sweden</i>; and consequently neglected
by those Kings; now at some set times in the Winter, they were obliged
to meet together in a place appointed, where they were to pay their tribute
to the Kings Officers, and be instructed in the Gospel by the Priests,
and also to give an account of what they learnt the year before. This custom
must needs have its beginning in <i>Gustavus</i>’s time, for he was the first
King that demanded tribute of the <i>Laplanders</i>, and consequently that assembled
them together for the paying of it. Besides <i>Olaus M.</i> mentions no
such institution; which he would have don had it bin received in his time.
Nay he confesses that if the <i>Laplanders</i> had a mind to have their Children
baptised, they were forc’t to carry them on their backs two hundred Italian
miles to a Christian Church, in some of their neighboring Countries, as
<i>Aongermannia</i>, <i>Helsingia</i>, and the like, and if they neglected this duty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
there was none to reprove them for it. This made <i>Gustavus</i> complain in a
Letter dated at <i>Stocholme</i>, July 24. 1556, that there were many among them,
who were never baptised, which proceeded from an opinion that those who
were baptised in their riper years, would dy Within 7 or 8 daies after; but
when <i>Gustavus</i> together with his Collectors sent Priests into <i>Lapland</i>,
their children were baptised, and they instructed at home. Nor were
they obliged only to a bare hearing of the word, but to a diligent attention,
because they were to be catechised afterwards, and give an account
of their progress; so that now it was that they began to be Christians in good
earnest, and in this respect it might with some reason be said that in this
last age the Gospel began to be preached among them, and that before they
were wholy ignorant of the means of their salvation. Now it was that they
had certain Priests appointed to instruct them, the first whereof, or at
least since the reformation, was one <i>Michael</i>, whom <i>Gustavus</i> in his before
mentioned Letter earnestly recommends to them, giving him especial command
by pious exhortation to reduce them to the true knowledg of God,
and the Christian Faith.</p>

<p>But this was more effectually don in the succeeding times of <i>Charles Gustavus
Adolphus</i>, and <i>Christina</i>; who first endowed Schools and Churches;
those two firm supports, without which Religion can neither maintain its
present strength, nor acquire more.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> the IX, about the latter end of his reign was the first that caused
Churches to be built in every one of the divisions or Marches at his own
peculiar charge; two of them are mentioned in <i>Lapponia Tornensis</i>, viz.
<i>Tenotekis</i> and <i>Jukasjærff</i>, whereof one was built, <i>ann.</i> 1600, the other 3
years after. <i>Christina</i> having found a silver mine there, followed his example;
and by a public Charter ordered the building of four more, in <i>Arwitsieff</i>,
<i>Arieplog</i>, <i>Silbojoch</i>, and <i>Nasafiell</i>, ann. 1640. then were Christian Churches
built in <i>Lapland</i> itself, and there are now reckoned in <i>Lapponia Aongermannia</i>
one, called <i>Aosalo</i>; in <i>Lapponia Umensis</i> one called <i>Lyæsala</i>; in <i>Lapponia
Pithensis</i> four, whose name are <i>Graatræsk</i>, <i>Arwitsierfs</i>, <i>Stora sawgcks</i>,
and <i>Arieplogs</i>; there was also a fifth called <i>Silbojochs</i>, but this was long ago
demolish’d and burnt by the <i>Danes</i>. In <i>Lapponia Luhlensis</i> there is one call’d
<i>Jochmoch</i>. There was also another called <i>Nafrilocht</i>, but this was burnt accidentally
not long since. In <i>Lapponia Tornensis</i> there are reckoned three,
<i>Juckochsierfs</i>, <i>Rounala</i>, and <i>Enotaches</i>. In <i>Lapponia Kimensis</i> only <i>Enare</i>.
All of them being 13 in number, except <i>Silbojochs</i> and <i>Nafrilochs</i>, are kept
in good repair, and frequented by the <i>Laplanders</i>. They all own the Kings,
and especially <i>Charles</i> the IX, for their Founders, excepting only <i>Kounala</i>,
which was built and adorned with a bell at the sole charge of 3 brothers
<i>Laplanders</i>, whose piety herein is the more commendable because they were
forc’t to fetch all the materials requisit for such a work thro long and troublesome
waies, out of <i>Norway</i> with their Rain-dears. A memorable example
which most men in our daies, tho desirous enough to seem pious and religious,
are so far from equalling, much more from exceeding, that they never
attemt to follow it. The manner of building their Temples was plain
indeed, but fit enough for the use they were designed to, the matter of them
is the same timber wherewith the <i>Swedes</i> usually build their houses. Adjoining
to their Churches they have belfrys, and houses for the use of Priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and the convenience of those who living at a great distance from the Church,
have the liberty of refreshing themselves here in the Winter time by the fire.
This constitution was first made by <i>Christina</i> ann. 1640, commanding the
Priests to be alwaies resident, whereas before they living a far off, came
but at some set times of the year.</p>

<p>Schools were first instituted by <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>, and I suppose in the
town of <i>Pithen</i>, something before the year 1619, for in that year <i>Nicolaus
Andreæ</i>, Minister of <i>Pithen</i>, dedicates his Ritual to him, in token of thanks
and commendation for this his piety. The reason why <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>
founded Schools, was chiefly because he saw the <i>Laplanders</i> profited very
little under the Swedish Priests preaching in a forreign language, as they
had hitherto don. Besides, the harshness of the air, and coursness of the
diet killed great part of the Priests, who had bin used to a better climate,
and made the rest more unwilling to undergo this hardship: therefore was
the first School instituted in <i>Pithen</i>, and committed to the charge of <i>Nicolaus
Andreæ</i>, who was also commanded for the better promoting of
knowledg there, to translate the most useful and necessary books out of the
Swedish into the Laplandish tongue. For the <i>Laplanders</i> before this were
wholy ignorant of letters, and had not a book writ in their language: the
first, which I suppose they had, was the <i>Primer</i>, such as children use to learn
containing the chief heads of Christian Religion, <i>viz.</i> the ten Commandments,
Apostles Creed, Lords Praier, and the like compiled by the aforesaid
<i>Nicolaus</i>, as himself witnesses: he likewise was the first that published
the Ritual in the Laplandish tongue, the book is now extant printed at
<i>Stockholm</i> by <i>Ignatius Meurer</i>, with this title, <i>Liber Cantionum quomodo sit
celebranda Missa Sermone Lappico</i>. These were the elements wherein they
were first to be instructed, afterwards there were other books printed,
amongst which was a <i>Manual</i> translated out of Swedish by <i>Joannes Tornæus</i>,
Minister and School-master of <i>Tornen</i>, containing the Psalms of <i>David</i>,
Song of <i>Solomon</i>, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Ecclesiasticus, <i>Luthers</i> Catechise,
sacred Hymns, Gospels, and Epistles, with the solemn Praiers. The history
of <i>Christs</i> Passion, and destruction of <i>Jerusalem</i>, the <i>Ritual</i>, and Praiers
of all sorts.</p>

<p>In the next place, for an encouragement to those that would send their
children to School, <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i> allowed money, not only for their
diet, but also for their clothes, and other necessaries, with a stipend for
the School-master: with these helps the <i>Laplanders</i> began more seriously to
consider of the Christian Religion, which was now preach’d to them in
no other language then their own: heretofore their Ministers using only
the Swedish tongue, they learnt somthing but understood it not, and muttered
some Praiers, but they knew not what: for somtimes there stood under
the Pulpit, an Interpreter who explained to the People as well as he could
what the Minister said at length. By the benefit of these aforesaid books they
began to understand what they praied for, and some of the Youth of <i>Lapland</i>
having studied at the University of <i>Upsal</i>, made so good progress in
the knowledg of the Liberal Arts and Sciences, and of the Christian Religion,
that they were entrusted with the Ministery.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have taken a view of <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i> his first care for the
advancement of Christianity in <i>Lapland</i>, but as all things in their begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>nings
find some opposition, so did the preaching of the word of God here;
first of all it was a matter of great difficulty to maintain a School without
the confines of <i>Lapland</i>, to which the Youth of that Nation should resort,
therefore in the second place it was advised by that famous man <i>Joannes
Skytte</i>, free Baron of <i>Duderhoff</i>, and Senator of the Kingdom, who to his
immortal praise obtained that a School might be erected by the King in
<i>Lapland</i> it self, in the Province of <i>Uma</i>, near the Church <i>Lyksala</i>, from
whence the School took its name. This was the second School the <i>Laplanders</i>
had, and by <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>, then engaged in a tedious war in <i>Germany</i>,
the charge of it was committed to the aforesaid <i>Joannes Skytte</i>, by a Roial
Charter, and setled upon his Family for ever, allowing the School-master
the whole Tithe, after the ordinary charges deducted; but still retaining
to the Crown the superintendency of the benefaction. The form thereof
is as follows,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent"><i>We</i> <span class="smcap">Gustavus Adolphus</span> <i>by the Grace of God
King of the</i> Goths <i>and</i> Vandals, <i>&amp;c. declare that

we our selves, after we were by the Divine Providence placed
in the Throne of this Kingdom, have earnestly endevor’d that
our Northern Subjects called</i> Laplanders <i>should be instructed,
in Arts and Letters; and be informed in the grounds of Christian
Religion, yet the distraction of the present time, hath hitherto
hindred our religious purpose: but least our attemt should be utterly
frustrated, we ordain and appoint our faithfull Senator, Chief Governor
of</i> Livonia, Ingria, <i>and</i> Carelia, <i>the illustrious Lord</i>
John Skytt <i>L. B. in</i> Dunderhoff, <i>Governor and Visitor of a
School to be erected in</i> Umalappmark, <i>he having undertaken that
Charge: We farther ordain that the Government of the said School,
shall from time to time continue and belong to the Successors, in his
family: and that the Master and Scholars in the school aforesaid, may
have a constant maintenance, we grant unto them the Tithes which
the inhabitants of that division, do yearly bring into the Store-house
of</i> Uma, <i>after the ordinary paiments are deducted. These
Tithes, with other gifts and benefactions which the aforesaid Lord</i>
John Skitt <i>shall by his diligence acquire for the said charitable use;
shall be disposed by him for the benefit of the said School, reserving

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>This School had some peculiar advantages over others, because its setlement
was firmly established, having for its Visitor, not the Minister of the
Parish, but a Senator of the Kingdom. Besides here was not only a salary
allowed to the Master and Scholars, but also an order to receive it out of
the Tithes of <i>Uma</i>; whereas the other had indeed a set stipend, but because
it was not certainly decreed where they should receive it, it was
not duely paid as the time and their necessities required, which was no
small disadvantage and impediment to their design. But all inconveniences
were here remedied and the salary most firmly setled; and not only so, but
also full autority granted unto the Illustrious Lord <i>John Skytte</i> to find
out and confirm any other means, which might conduce more to the good of
that foundation. Neither was that eminent man wanting out of his singular
piety to God, and love of learning, to make this his whole business; till at
last he gathered a sum of five thousand Dollars, partly thro his own, and
partly thro his friends liberality, which he delivered to the Queen <i>Christina</i>
for the use of a Copper Mine, that in lieu thereof the School of <i>Uma</i>
might yearly receive the whole revenue of the Crown, due from certain
Towns in that Province. This request of his the Queen easily granted, and
two years after issu’d out her Letters patents, and a new Charter by the
Protectors of the Kingdom, whose worthy Commemoration is not to be
omitted. The words of the Charter are as follow,</p>

<p>This is that School to which the <i>Laplanders</i> ow their Progress in the
knowledg and love of Christian Religion, which appears from those many
useful and eminent Persons who have bin there bred; also the success may
be seen from the testimonials of the Examiners, who were constituted

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent"><i>We, whose names are underwritten, do testify that we were
called by the Reverend and Learned</i> M. Olaus <i>our Pastor
of the Church of</i> Uma, <i>to be present at the examination of the Laplandish
Youth frequenting the School of</i> Lyksa <i>in the Province of</i>
Uma; <i>we also testify that we did hear them examined by their Rector
our aforesaid Pastor. First, they altogether sang the Psalms of</i>
David <i>translated into the Swedish language, as they are now used
in the Church: next they all, and singular repeted the</i> Primer,
<i>containing not only the Elements of Speech, but the Lords Praier,
ten Commandments, Apostles Creed, the words used in administring
the Sacraments of Baptism, and the Lords Supper; also the
Graces before and after meat, together with the Morning and Evening
Praiers. This Book they all read according to the manner
prescribed in other Schools, and the more ingenious of them did
distinctly and without hesitation repete the little Catechism made by</i>
Luther: <i>Besides this, they read the Gospels for Sundaies and Holy-daies
as they are published in the Swedish tongue, this was the
task of all the Scholars. Only 8 of them being of slower parts, did
nevertheless emulate the more ingenious according to their abilities.
Now they all begin to learn the Fundamentals in the Laplandish
Idiom, that they may instruct their Country-men in their own mother
tongue. This school exercise and the fruit arising from thence as it
exceeded our expectation, to see the illiterate Youth in a short time
by the blessing of God, learn the Principles of our salvation, which
better Scholars have bin much longer in attaining to, so ought we
to give singular thanks to Gods who hath made their endevors so
successful. Nor must we omit the deserved Commendation of those
pious men, who by their bountiful largesses founded and endowed
the School, and at this time maintain it; altho for the reward of
their piety must expect the blessing of God, according as he hath
promised. Witness our hands and seals. Dated in the place aforesaid</i>
Ann. 1634. Jacobus Andreæ Buræus. Petrus Jonæ. Andreas
Hacquini. Jacobus Nicolai. Olaus Olai.</p></div>

<p>From this testimony it appears that the School was frequented by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
small number of the Laplandish Youth, also that they were not wholly
unfit for the study of learning and Religion; making it their chief care to
learn those things which are especially necessary to the improving of a
Christian life. Last of all, the readiness of the <i>Laplanders</i> to send their
children to School: so that now there appears another face of Religion in
<i>Lapland</i> then what there was in former ages, because the Kings have taken
greater care in providing for Churches, Schools, Books, Ministers, and
School-masters. The Priests in like manner are more careful, being now for
the most part <i>Laplanders</i>, or skilful in that tongue, whereof there is in
<i>Lapponia Umensis</i> one, in <i>Lapponia Pithensis</i> 3, in <i>Lapponia Luhlensis</i> one,
whose trouble is the greater, because the Country is large and the inhabitants
dispersed.</p>

<p>In <i>Lapponia Tornensis</i> and <i>Kiemensis</i> they have both Laplandish and Swedish
Priests, who once a year at their public Fairs in February visit the
Country, baptising their children, and preaching to them in the <i>Finnish</i>
language, which they seem to understand. For their reward they have one
third part of the Rain-dears, which the <i>Laplanders</i> are bound to pay to
the Crown: and whereas every <i>Laplander</i> was obliged to pay for a tax either
two pair of shoes, or a white Fox, or a pound of Pike, this is now
equally divided between the King and the Priest; which makes not only
the Priests more chearful in doing their duty, but the People also more diligent
in their performances. Hence it is that they pay their Ministers
so much honor and respect, saluting them at their first coming with
bowing their head, giving them in token of Reverence the title of <i>Herrai</i>,
i.e. <i>Sir</i>, conducting them upon their Rain-dears to their Cottages, adorned
with birch bows, covered with their furrs, and shewing them all the
civility they have. Upon a table or rather a plank laid upon the ground
they set them meat, which is usually fish, or flesh of Rain-dear dried together
with the tongue and marrow. They use neither Salt, Bread nor
Wine, all which the Priests are forc’t to bring with them, the <i>Laplanders</i>
drinking only Water, because the extremity of the cold spoils their Beer.
They are careful in observing Sundaies, refraining both themselves and
their Cattel from all work on that day, and somtimes on the day before;
nay some there are who refuse to milk their Raindears on Sundaies. While
the Sermon is preaching they attend diligently; and in singing of Psalms
they are so zealous that they strive who shall sing best. They very much
reverence and frequent the Sacraments, especially that of Baptism which
they never defer; but the women themselves within eight or fourteen
daies after their delivery do often bring their children thro long and tedious
waies to the Priest. They likewise pay much reverence to the Lords
Supper, and to the ceremonies of Confession and Absolution, which are
alwaies used before that Sacrament, which they now are really partakers
of, whereas in the times of Popery they received it without any solemn
consecration. Neither do they neglect the other parts of Christian Piety.
They most religiously abstain from swearing, cursing and blasphemy: they are
very charitable to the poor, and just, insomuch that there are scarce any robberies
ever heard of in the Country. Their mutual conversation is very courteous,
especially among persons of the same Country or family, often visiting
and discoursing with one another. This they learn from the precepts of Chri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>stianity,
which requiring them not only to regulate their Faith, but their
lives, teaches that tho there be three Persons, the Father, Son, and holy
Ghost, yet they are but one God. And as by the help of Christianity they
learn the rule of true piety, so do they utterly abhor all their ancient superstition.
They pull down all their drums, and burn and demolish all their
Images of wood and stone. A memorable example hereof is mentioned by
<i>Johannes Tornæus</i> in this manner. A certain <i>Laplander</i>, just, pious, and
wealthy, named <i>Petrus Peiwie</i> dwelling in <i>Peldojærf</i>, at a Village of <i>Lappmarkia
Tornensis</i>, with all his family worshipped the Idol <i>Seita</i>: it happened
upon a certain time that his Rain-dears died in great numbers;
whereupon he implored the assistance of his <i>Seita</i>. But he praied in vain,
for his Rain-dears died still. At length with his whole family and good store
of dry wood, he took a journy to the place where <i>Seita</i> stood: round
about the Idoll he strewed green bows of Firr, and offered sacrifice to him,
the skins, horns, and skulls of Rain-dears; at last he prostrates himself
with his whole family before the Idol, beseeching him that he would by
some sign testify unto him, that he was the true God. But after a whole
days praiers and devotions finding no sign given, he sets fire to the combustible
wood, and burns down the Idol of the Town. When his offended
neighbours sought to kill him, he asked them why they would not permit
the God to revenge himself for the affront. But <i>Peiwie</i> became so constant
an adherent to the Christian Religion, that when others threatned with
their charms to mischief him, he on the contrary repeated the Lords Prayer,
and the Apostles Creed. He burnt all the <i>Seitas</i> he could meet with, and at
length sent his eldest Son <i>Wuollaba</i> to <i>Enorreby</i> to do the like there; for
which he was forc’t to fly into <i>Norway</i> to avoid the <i>Inarenses</i>, who lay in
wait for him. There was also one <i>Clement</i>, a <i>Lappo-Jenabiensis</i> whose Mother
being grievously sick, he sought remedy from the Drum, but his
Mother died notwithstanding; whereupon he cut his Drum in pieces, alledging
that he saw no use of it.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have seen the Christian Religion much better received and improved
by the <i>Laplanders</i>, and applied to their daily conversation, then
what it was in ancient times. And from hence we may collect the care of
those who by their authority, counsell or ministery did promote it; yet
cannot we triumph over Pagan impiety wholly rooted out; as shall appear
by the following Chapter.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of some remains of Paganism in</i> Lapland
<i>at this time.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">By the present State of Religion in <i>Lapland</i>, it cannot be doubted
but all possible means were used by their pious Kings and Priests,
for the extirpating of superstition and its evil consequences: nevertheless
there remain some reliques thereof to employ their farther care and endeavour,
many gross errours prevailing among them, which renders the
reality of their conversion suspicious, as if they were still in love with the
erroneous opinions of their Ancestors, especially some of the <i>Norwegian
Laplanders</i>, whose Idolatry sufficiently demonstrates that all their pretences
to Christianity are but fictitious. But tho it were impiety to believe
this of all, since experience shews us the contrary; yet it cannot be denied,
but that many of them profess Christianity rather out of dissimulation
then any real affection. One chief reason why they so stifly adhere to
their superstition and impiety, proceeds from the miscarriage of their
Priests, who either take no care of instructing the People, or vilify their
doctrine by the sordidness of their lives; whilst under a pretence of propagating
the Gospell, they endeavor only to advance their own revennues.
This the <i>Laplanders</i>, before none of the richest, could not bare; to see themselves
opprest and disabled by the exactions of the Priests. The truth of
this <i>Olaus Magnus</i> strives to confute, calling it an impious and false assertion,
but he brings nothing to prove the truth of what he saies, nor
answers <i>Ziegler</i>, by telling a fair story, of the industry and liberality of
some in the Southern parts: and particularly that his brother <i>Joannes</i> came
to the utmost border of <i>Jemptia</i>, and gave a large Alms to the poor people
there, and at his own great charge set up a Salt-work. A farther cause of
the little improvement of Christianity, is the vastness of the Country, some
of the Inhabitants living above 200 miles from the Christian Churches.
But tho this cause is now in some degree removed by having Churches more
frequently, yet that inconvenience still remains; because they are yet very
far distant, particularly in <i>Lapponia Luhlensis</i>, as we have already mentioned.
There are other causes of this unhappy effect, which more particularly reflect
upon the Natives. As their strong inclination to superstition, which
hath bin formerly mentioned, and the occasions thereof intimated. To this
we may add the high estimation they have of their Predecessors, whom they
think more wise then to have bin ignorant of what God they ought to adore,
or the manner of his worship: wherefore out of reverence to them they will
not recede from their opinions, least they should seem to reprove them of
ignorance or impiety. Lastly, this happens upon the account of inveterate
Custom, which at all times is hardly forgot, especially where it prevails
as a Law. This is it that darkens their understanding, and renders it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>capable
of discerning between true and false. For these and some other
reasons there remain severall tracks of Superstition and Idolatry, w<sup>ch</sup> require
no small time to be wore out; as we see in severall of the meaner sort, nor
only in <i>Swedland</i>, but in <i>Germany</i>, <i>France</i>, and other Countries, where
there is found much of the old superstition, tho in other things they are
orthodox enough.</p>

<p>Amongst the <i>Laplanders</i> these opinions may be reduced to two heads,
for they are superstitious and paganish, or Magical and Diabolical. Of the
first sort some of their superstitions are only vain and fabulous, others very
impious and heathenish. As first of all their distinctions between white
and black daies. Of the later sort they account the Feasts of <i>S. Katharine</i>
and <i>S. Mark</i>, whom they call <i>Cantepaive</i>, and <i>S. Clement</i>, upon which daies
they abstain from all business, and chiefly from hunting. And of this they
give two reasons; first, because they say if they should hunt on any of those
daies, their bows and arrows would be broken, and they should forfeit their
good success in that sport all the year. In like manner they esteem the first
day of Christmas to be unlucky, insomuch that Masters of families go not
out of their Cottages, not so much as to Church, but send their Children
and Servants, for fear of I know not what spirits and dæmons, which
they suppose to wander about the air in great Companies upon that day;
and that they must first be appeased by certain Sacrifices, which we shall
mention hereafter. This superstition, I suppose, sprang from a misinterpretation
of the story which they heard from their Priest, how a great host
of Angels came down from Heaven upon our Saviours Nativity, and frighted
the Shepheards. They are likewise great observers of Omens, and amongst
others they guess at the success of the day from the first beast they meet in
the morning. They forbid the woman to go out of that door thro which
the man went a hunting, as thinking the way would be improsperous if
a woman trod the same steps.</p>

<p>And herein they are only superstitious but in what follows, they are impious
and heathenish. As first they go to Church not out of any devotion,
but compulsion. Next they stick at several Principles of the Christian Religion,
especially the resurrection of the dead, the union of the body and
soul, and the immortality of the soul. For they fancy to themselves that
men and beasts go the same way; and will not be perswaded that there is
any life after this. Whereupon one <i>Georgius</i>, a Laplandish Priest, desired
upon his death bed that he might be buried amongst the <i>Laplanders</i>, that
at the last day when he should rise together with them, they might find his
doctrine of the resurrection true. Notwithstanding they believe that something
of a man remains after he is dead, but they know not what it is;
which was the very opinion of the Heathens, who therefore feign’d their
Manes to be somewhat that did remain after their death. A third impiety
they are guilty of, is joining their own feign’d gods with God and Christ,
and paying them equall reverence and worship, as if God and the Devil
had made an agreement together to share their devotions between them.</p>

<p>Those of <i>Lapponia Pithensis</i> and <i>Luhlensis</i> have their greater and lesser
Gods; the greater to whom they pay especial worship are, <i>Thor</i>, <i>Storjunkaren</i>,
and the <i>Sun</i>. <i>Damianus à Goes</i> writes that they worship the Fire and
Statues of stone: but those Statues are only the Images of <i>Storjunkaren</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and the Fire is only an embleme of the Sun; for that they worshipped Fire
it self for a God, is very false, as appears from <i>Tornæus</i>, who made particular
enquiry into that thing. The same may be said of <i>Peucer</i>, who
taking his mistake from the wooden Image of <i>Thor</i>, reports that they worship
wood. So that there are only three, and that among the <i>Pithenses</i> and
<i>Luhlenses</i>; for the <i>Tornenses</i> and <i>Kiemenses</i> knew nothing of them, but in
their stead under one common name worshipped a Deity, whom they called
<i>Seita</i>, whereof every family and almost every person had one. Nevertheless
there was one chief Idoll to which all the neighbourhood paid devotion.
But tho this word <i>Seita</i> denotes any God among the <i>Laplanders</i>, yet may
we suppose that under that name, especially as it signifies the publick Idoll,
they worshipped the same, which the <i>Luhlenses</i> call <i>Tiermes</i>, or <i>Aijeke</i> (i. e.)
thunderer, or father, by others named <i>Thor</i>. And by the private Idols they
mean’t him, who by the <i>Luhlenses</i> is called <i>Storjunkare</i>, making the difference
to consist not in the Gods but their names. The <i>Tornenses</i> rather using
a generall appellation, and calling them all <i>Seitas</i>, whereas the <i>Luhlenses</i>
call the greater <i>Termes</i> or <i>Aijeke</i>, and the lesser <i>Storjunkar</i>. And if one attend
to their manner of worshipping these Gods, they will appear to be
the same. Besides these greater, the <i>Pithenses</i>, <i>Luhlenses</i>, and their neighbours
have some inferior Gods, as the <i>Tornenses</i> likewise have, tho they
worship them all under one name, excepting only that which they call
<i>Wiru Accha</i>, signifying a <i>Livonian</i> old woman, which <i>Olaus Petr.</i> with some
alteration calls <i>Viresaka</i>. This was only the bare trunk of a tree, and is
now wholly rotten. But who the inferior Gods were, or to what end they
were worshipped, there is no mention made; but we may guess from what
we find observable among the other <i>Laplanders</i>. First under that name they
worshipped the ghosts of departed persons, but especially of their kindred,
for they thought there was some divinity in them, and that they were
able to do harm: just such as the <i>Romans</i> fancied their Manes to be; therefore
it was that they offered Sacrifice to them, of which more hereafter.
Besides these Manes they worship other Spectres and Demons, which they
say wander about Rocks, Woods, Rivers and Lakes, such as the <i>Romans</i>
describe their <i>Fauni</i>, <i>Sylvani</i>, and <i>Tritons</i> to be. The third sort dreaded
by them are <i>Genii</i>, whether good or bad, which they suppose to fly in
the air about Christmas, as we intimated before; these they call <i>Juhlii</i> from
the word <i>Juhl</i>, denoting at present the Nativity of Christ; but formerly
the new year. And these are the Gods which the <i>Laplanders</i> jointly adore
with God and our Saviour; of which we shall now speak particularly, and
of their respective worship.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the heathenish Gods of the</i> Laplanders, <i>and
their manner of worship at this day.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">We have shewed in the foregoing Chapter that there were three
principal Gods worshipped by the <i>Laplanders</i>; the first is <i>Thor</i>,
signifying thunder, in the Swedish Dialect called <i>Thordoen</i>, by the <i>Laplanders</i>
themselves <i>Tiermes</i>, that is any thing that makes a noise, agreeing
very well with the notion the <i>Romans</i> had of <i>Jupiter</i> the thunderer, and
the God <i>Taramis</i>, which I have treated of in the History of <i>Upsal</i>. This
<i>Tiermes</i> or thunder they think by a special virtue in the Sky to be alive; intimating
thereby that power from whence thunder proceeds, or the thundring
God, wherefore he is by them called <i>Aijeke</i>, which signifies <i>grand</i>,
or <i>great-grand-Father</i>, as the <i>Romans</i> saluted their father <i>Jupiter</i>; and the
<i>Swedes</i> their <i>Gubba</i>. This <i>Aijeke</i> when he thunders is by the <i>Laplanders</i> call’d
<i>Tiermes</i>, by the <i>Scythians</i>, <i>Tarami</i>, and by the <i>Swedes</i>, <i>Tor</i> or <i>Toron</i>. This
<i>Tiermes</i> or <i>Aijeke</i> the <i>Laplanders</i> suppose to have power over the life and
death, health and sickness of man: and also over the hurtfull Demons who
frequent Rocks and Mountains, whom he often chastises, and sometimes
destroies with his lightning, as the <i>Latins</i> fanci’d their <i>Jupiter</i> to do, for
which end they give him a bow in his hand to shoot the Demons with, which
they call <i>Aijeke dauge</i>: also they give him a mallet, which they call <i>Aijeke
Wetschera</i>, to dash out the brains of the said evil spirits. Wherefore because
the <i>Laplanders</i> expect so many blessings from their <i>Tiermes</i>, and believe
he bestows life on them, and preserves their health, and that they
cannot die unless it be his plesure, and drives away the Demons, which
are prejudicial to their hunting, fowling, and fishing, and never hurts
them but when their offences deserve it: therefore he is to be worshipped in
the first place. The next of the principal Gods is <i>Storjunkare</i>, which tho
it be a <i>Norwegian</i> word, <i>Junkare</i> in that language signifying the Governor
of a Province, yet is it used by the <i>Laplanders</i> now; tho perhaps it was
not in use till some of them became subjects to <i>Norway</i>. Certain it is, that
this is not the only name of that God, for he is also called <i>Stourra Passe</i> (i.e.)
<i>Great Saint</i>, as appears by a Hymn which is sung at his Sacrifices. His name
they reverence very much, and pay him frequenter, if not greater devotion
then other Gods, for they suppose him to be their <i>Tiermes</i> his Lieutenant,
and as it were Royal Prefect, adding <i>Stœre</i>, which signifys <i>greater</i>
for distinction sake. Now they worship <i>Storejunkar</i>, because they think
that they receive all their blessings thro his hands, and that all beasts and
Cattel, are subject to his will, and that he governs them as <i>Tiermes</i> doth
men and spirits; wherefore he can give them to whom he will, and none
can receive them without his pleasure. These beasts therefore supplying
the <i>Laplanders</i> with meat and clothes, it may easily be imagined how ne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>cessary
they held it to worship <i>Storjunkare</i>. And these are the two peculiar
Gods of the <i>Laplanders</i>, whereof one hath the dominion over men, the
other over beasts; one bestows life, the other all things required to the
sustaining of it. <i>Tornæus</i> saies they report of him that he hath often appeared
to Fowlers or Fishers in the shape of a tall personable man, habited
like a Nobleman, with a Gun in his hand, and his feet like those of a
bird. As often as he appears standing on the shore, or in the ship by them,
they say he makes their fishing successful, and kills birds that happen to
fly by with his Gun, which he bestows upon those that are present. It
is reported that a <i>Laplander</i> being to guide one of the Kings Lieutenant,
when he came over against a mountain where <i>Storejunkar</i> was supposed to
dwell, he stood still, and setting the helve of his Ax down upon the Ice,
turned it round, professing that he did it in honor of their munificent God,
who dwelt there. And tho there is mention made but of one mountain where
the <i>Laplander</i> performed this ceremony, yet we may suppose he would
have don it oftner, if there had happened to be more hills in the way. But
perhaps this distinction of name is used by the <i>Laplanders</i> which border
upon <i>Norway</i>, especially in <i>Lulalapland</i>, from his habit and clothing; and
because he used to appear in another dress to them of <i>Lapponia Kiemensis</i>
and <i>Tornensis</i>, therefore they did not worship him under that name, but by
the common appellation of <i>Seita</i>, from whom they believed that they receive
the benefits of hunting, fishing, and fowling.</p>

<p>I come now to the <i>Sun</i>, their third God, which is common to them with
all other Pagans, him they call <i>Baiwe</i>, and worship him chiefly for his light
and heat: also because they believe him to be the Author of Generation,
and that all things are made by his means, especially their Rain-dears, of
whom and their young they think he hath a particular care to cherish them
by his heat, and bring them suddenly to strength and maturity. And
being they live in a cold Country where their native heat is diminish’d,
and often wholly extinguish’d, being they have nothing to sustain themselves
with but the flesh of Rain-dear, they think it very fit to pay the Sun
very great honors, who is the Author of so great blessings to them, and who
at his return restores them that light which they lost by his departure, and
that not for a day or two, but for several weeks, which being pai’d, the
new day seems more welcom to them, by reason of long absence.</p>

<p>To every one of these principal Gods they pay a several sort of worship;
which consists first in the diversity of places dedicated to their service,
next in the diversity of images erected to them in these places; lastly, in
the diversity of Sacrifices which they offer to them. The place where they
worship their <i>Thor</i> or <i>Tiermes</i> is a piece of ground set apart for this superstition,
on the backside of their Huts, above a bows shoot off; there upon
boards set together like a table they place their images. This table serves
them instead of an Altar, which they surround with bows of birch and pine;
with the same bows also they strew the way from their Huts to the Altar:
and as the table serves them for an Altar, so do the bows for a Temple.
The same account, only omitting the table, doth <i>Tornæus</i> give of the <i>Tornenses</i>
and <i>Kiemenses</i> worshipping of <i>Seita</i>, so that they may seem to be
one and the same God: unless his description should be appli’d to <i>Storjunkar</i>
rather, because he mentions Lakes to be the place of his worship; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
was proper to <i>Storjunkar</i>, as shall be shewn. But I suppose the <i>Seitas</i>
were worshipped in other places as well as Lakes, and so they signifi’d both
Gods under one name, and that <i>Tornæus</i> was not so curious as to distinguish
between them. In the same place where they worshipp’d <i>Tiermes</i> they
worshipp’d the Sun also, and upon the same table too, which makes me
suspect that they were but one God; whom they called <i>Tiermes</i>, when they
invok’d him in the behalf of their lives, healths, or preservation from Demons,
and <i>Baiwe</i> when they beg’d of him light or warmth, or any thing that
might fortify them against the cold. But the place where <i>Storjunkar</i> was
worshipped, was upon some peculiar mountains, and on the banks of Lakes:
for almost every family hath its particular rocks and hills appointed for this
business. Some of these rocks are so high and craggy that they are impassable
to any but <i>Storjunkar</i>. But it must not be supposed he lives only in rocks
and cliffes of mountains, but also on the shores of Lakes and banks of Rivers,
for there also he is peculiarly worshipped, because the <i>Laplanders</i> have observed
the same apparitions in these places, that they usually do upon
rocks and hills, namely <i>Storjunkar</i> habited and armed according to the
description already given, by which his presence they think he testifies
his great love for those places, which therefore they have in great veneration,
and call them <i>Passewara</i>, i. e. <i>Sacred mountains</i>, or rocks belonging
to <i>Storjunkar</i>, supposing they cannot pay their devotion to him in any
place better; or be surer of finding him, then where he himself appears.
To these places they allot their certain bounds and confines, that all people
may know how far the sanctified ground reaches, and avoid those evils, which
otherwise <i>Storejunkar</i> would certainly inflict upon them for violating his
holy place. Now since every family, that is given to this superstition hath
its peculiar place of worship, it is manifest that there is good store of them
throughout <i>Lapland</i>. <i>Sam. Rheen</i> reckons up thirty of them in the Province
of <i>Luhla</i>.</p>

<p>The first by the River <i>Waikijaur</i>, about &frac12; a mile from the Laplandish
Church called <i>Jochmochs</i>.</p>

Church.</p>

<p>The third in an Island of the River <i>Porkijaur</i>, a mile and half off the
River.</p>

<p class="noindent">
Neither are these all the places in the Country that are dedicated to this use,
but there are several others which the Idolatrous People endeavour to
concele, that they may avoid the suspicion of this impiety and their deserved
punishment. But in other parts of <i>Lapland</i> the number is far greater as
may be easily understood; and therefore I shall not tire the Reader with
a recitall of them. For all these places they have a high esteem, whether
dedicated to <i>Thor</i>, the <i>Sun</i>, or <i>Storjunkar</i>, so that they exclude all women
from them, not permitting them so much as to go behind the house where
<i>Thor</i> is worshipped, and prohibiting all marriageble women to come near
the borders of <i>Storjunkars</i> consecrated hills: and the reason is because they
think that Sex, especially at that age, not pure enough for those devotions,
but not knowing who are pure and who are not, to prevent all danger
they prohibite the whole Sex, who if they transgress herein, they must
expect many misfortunes to befall them, and perhaps death it self.</p>

<p>I come now to the Images of their Gods, for with these they used to
honour them. <i>Thors</i> image, was alwaies made of wood, wherefore he is
called by them <i>Muora Jubmel</i>, i. e. the Wooden God. And because in
<i>Lapponia Tornensis</i>, as well as in other places they make their Gods of wood,
it is very probable that they worship <i>Tiermes</i>, tho they call him <i>Seita</i>.
Of this wood, which is alwaies Birch, they make so many Idols as they have
Sacrifices, and when they have done they keep them in a cave by some hill
side. The shape of them is very rude, only at the top they are made to represent
a mans head, according to the description of <i>Matthias Steuchius</i>,
which he relates from his Father, who was Superintendent of <i>Hernosandensis</i>,
and had the oversight of all things relating to Piety and Religion
in most parts of <i>Lapland</i>. Of the root of the tree they make the head, and
of the trunk the body of the image: for those Birches which grow in Fenny
grounds have usually their roots growing round, and from them there shoot
out other little roots, so that it is easily fitted to the shape of a mans
head. Now to manifest this to be <i>Thor</i>, they put a hammer into his right
hand, which is as it were his ensign by which he is known. Into his head
they drive a nail of Iron or Steel, and a small piece of flint to strike fire
with, if he hath a mind to it. Tho I rather suppose it was first used to be
an emblem of fire, which together with the Sun they worshipped in <i>Thor</i>,
whose Image is here delineated.</p>

</a>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But tho they usually make them in this shape, yet there are some, especially
in <i>Lapponia Tornensis</i>, who worship a meer stump. They have no
Image of the Sun, either because he is conspicuous enough of himself, or
because in the mystery of their Religion he is the same with <i>Thor</i>: but <i>Storjunkar</i>
is represented with a stone, as is clearly proved by several writers,
and easily deduced from others. The form of this stone (if we will
believe <i>Olaus Petri Neuren.</i>) was like a Bird, <i>Samuel Rheen</i> saies it somtimes
represents a man, and somtimes som other creature. The truth is its shape
is so rude, that they may sooner fancy it like somthing themselves, then
perswade other People that it is so. In the mean time their fancy is so
strong, that they really believe it represents their <i>Storjunkar</i>, and worship
it accordingly. Neither do they use any art in polishing it, but take it as
they find it upon the banks of Lakes and Rivers. In this shape therefore
they worship it, not as tho it were so made by chance, but by the immediate
will and procurement of their god <i>Storjunkar</i>, that it might be
sacred to him. Thus they erect it as his image, and call it <i>Kied Kie Jubmal</i>
i. e. the stone God. The rudeness of these Images gave <i>Tornæus</i> occasion to
deny that they had any shape at all, only made rough and hollow by the
falling of water upon them, tho their hallowness without doubt occasioned
the <i>Laplanders</i> fancy of their likeness to something: but he confesses that
in an Island made by a Cataract of the River <i>Tornatræsk</i> called <i>Darra</i>,
there are found <i>Seitæ</i>, just in the shape of a man, one of them very tall,
and hard by 4 others something lower, with a kind of Cap on their heads.
But because the passage into the Island is dangerous by reason of the Cataract,
the <i>Laplanders</i> are forc’t to desist from going to that place, so that
it is impossible now to know how those stones are worshipped, or how
they came there. These stones are not set up by themselves, but lie 3 or
4 together, according as they find them; the first of which they honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
with the title of <i>Storjunkar</i>, the second they call <i>Acte</i>, or <i>Storjunkars</i>
wife; the third his Son or Daughter, and the rest his Servants. And this
they do because they would not have their <i>Storjunkar</i>, who is <i>Thors</i> Viceroy,
in a worse condition then other Roial Prefects, whom they usually
see thus accompanied by their Wives and Children, and Attendants.
His representation is as follows</p>

<p>I come now to their Sacrifices and other Ceremonies used to their
Gods. First it is observable that they are performed only by men, all
women being excluded; they esteeming it as great a crime for a woman to
offer Sacrifice as to frequent the consecrated places. They never offer Sacrifice
till they have enquired of their God whether he will accept it or no.
This they do with a certain instrument which they call <i>Kannus</i>, not unlike
the old fashioned Drums, from whence they are usually called Laplandish
Drums, and shall be exactly described hereafter. This Drum being beaten,
and some Songs sung, they bring the designed Sacrifice to <i>Thor</i>, who if he
signifies by a ring in the Drum that the Sacrifice is pleasing to him, they
fall presently to work: otherwise they carry it to the Sun, and so to <i>Storjunkar</i>,
till one of them will accept of it. The manner of it is thus. They
pull off some of the hair at the bottom of the beasts neck, and bind it
to a ring which is fastned to the Drum, then one of them beats the
Drum, and all the rest sing these words, <i>What sayst thou ô Great and Sacred
God, dost thou accept this Sacrifice, which we design to offer unto thee?</i> And
while they chant these words, they repete the name of the mountain where
they are: then if the ring rests on that part of the Drum where the God
is pictured, they take it for granted that the God is pleased, and so proceed
to the Ceremony; or else they carry the Sacrifice to <i>Thor</i>, and use
the like form of words, <i>Father God will you have my Sacrifice</i>. <i>Peucer</i> ei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>ther
thro false intelligence, or misapprehension, relates this business somthing
differently, they have (saies he) a brasen Drum whereon they paint
several sorts of Beasts, Birds, and Fishes, such as they can easily procure:
bolt upright upon this Drum they fix an iron pearch, upon which stands
a brasen Frog, which at the beating of the Drum falls down upon some
of the pictures, and that creature whose picture the Frog touches, they
sacrifice. Their usuall sacrifices are Rain-dears, tho sometimes they use other
creatures, as Dogs, Cats, Lambs and Hens, which they fetch out of <i>Norway</i>.
The 3<sup>d</sup> thing observable is that they offer their Sacrifices usually in
the Autumn, because, I suppose, the Winter and night being at hand they
think they have more need of their Gods assistance, which may probably
be the reason too why every year about that time they make a new image
for <i>Thor</i>, which is alwaies don 14 daies before Michaelmas. And thus they
consecrate it, first they sacrifice the Rain-dear, then taking out his bones
they anoint the Idol with the blood and fat, and bury the flesh and bones
under ground. Besides this Idol they erect one to him every time they
sacrifice, and then they place them all one by another upon a table behind
their Hut. First when the God hath approved of the Sacrifice, which is
usually a Buck to <i>Thor</i>, they bind it behind the house, then with a sharp
knife they run him thro the heart, and gather the heart-blood, wherewith
they anoint the Idol, into a vessell. After that having placed the images
right, and adorned the table, they approach reverently to it, anoint
the head and back all over with the blood, but on his breast they only draw
several Crosses. Behind him they place the skull, feet, and horns of the
sacrificed Dear; before him they place a Coffer made of the bark of Birch,
into which they put a bit of every member of the Rain-dear, with some
of the fat, and the rest of the flesh they convert to their private uses. This
is the manner of the <i>Laplanders</i> sacrificing to <i>Thor</i>. But when they offer
Sacrifice to <i>Storjunkar</i>, which is likewise a male Dear, then first they run
a red thred thro his right ear, and bind him, and sacrifice him in the place
they did that to <i>Thor</i>; preserving the blood likewise in a vessel. Then he
who performs the Ceremony takes the horns and the bones of the head and
neck, with the feet and hoofs, and carries them to the mountain of that
<i>Storjunkar</i>, for whom the Sacrifice was designed. When he comes near the
sacred Stone, he reverently uncovers his head, and bows his body, paying
all the ceremonies of respect and honor. Then he anoints the Stone with
the fat and blood, and places the horns behind it. Unto the right horn they
ty the Rain-dears yard, and to the left some red thred wrought upon tin
with a little piece of silver. The same rites that are observed to <i>Storjunkar</i>
are also used to <i>Seita</i>, to whom the <i>Laplanders</i> usually sacrifice upon
Holydaies, or after some loss or misfortune. Then making their Praiers
and Devotions to the Idol in their best clothes, they offer him all manner
of oblations, and the choisest parts of the Rain-dear, as the flesh,
fat, skin, bones, horns, and hoofs, whereof there are great heaps to be seen
at this day where <i>Seita</i> was worshipped. The horns are found placed one
above another, in the fashion of a fence to the God, which is therefore
by the <i>Laplanders</i> called <i>Tiorfwigardi</i>, that is a Court fenced with horns,
which are sometimes above a thousand in number. Before these horns they
used to hang a garland made of Birch tree, stuck about with bits of flesh cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
from every member of the sacrifice. This I suppose first caused the mistake
of those who reported that the <i>Laplanders</i> worshipped the horns
of Rain-dears. All the flesh that remains of the sacrifice the <i>Laplanders</i>
spend in their houses: and this is the ordinary way of sacrificing to <i>Storjunkar</i>.
Two other methods there are but less used; one when they bring
the sacrifice alive to the hill where the Idol is placed: another when they
would do so, but cannot climb the hill where <i>Storjunkar</i> is by reason of its
steepness. For the first they kill the sacrifice hard by the Idol, and when
they have performed the usual ceremonies, they presently boil the flesh
in the place, especially that about the head and neck, and invite their
friends to the eating of it. This they call <i>Storjunkars</i> Feast, and when
they have done they leave the skin behind them. This is not used in all <i>Storjunkars</i>
hills, but only in some peculiar place where he hath manifested
to them that he will be worshipped so. The other way of sacrificing is when
the hill is so craggy that they cannot ascend it with their sacrifice, then
they throw up a stone to the top of the mountain, which they dip in the
blood and go away, as having paid their devotion. But as (besides the
sacrifice) they once a year honour <i>Thor</i> with a new Image; so do they
<i>Storjunkar</i> with fresh bowes twice every year. The first time in Summer
with birch and grass; next in Winter with pine. The same also <i>Tornæus</i> reports
of the <i>Seitas</i>. Then it is they seek whether their God be favorable
and propitious to them or no: for when they go to strow the bows and
grass under him, if the stone proves light, they hope he will be kind; but
if it be something heavier then ordinary, they suspect he is angry with
them, and immediatly to reconcile him they devote some oblations to him.
And thus are <i>Peucerus</i> his words to be understood, when the <i>Laplanders</i>
(says he) go a hunting or fishing, or upon any other enterprise, they try
their success by the weight of their God, who if he is easily moved, they
take it for granted that he approves of their design; if hardly, then he
dislikes it: but if he be unmoveable then they suppose him offended with
them. This is not to be understood of all their affairs, but only when they
lay fresh straw under him, for at other times they enquire his plesure with
a drum, of which I have already spoken.</p>

<p>It remains now that we treat of the sacrifices used to the Sun, these are
young Rain-dears, and those not bucks but does: the rites are most of
them the same with those already mentioned; only instead of a red string
thro the right ear of <i>Storjunkars</i> sacrifice, they run a white one thro the
Suns; then they make a garland, not of birch, but willow, about as big as
the hoop of an Hogshead. This they place upon a table behind the Hut
where they sacrifice to <i>Thor</i>, not upon the same table, but one like it.
And this sacrifice differs from the other in that there are neither images
erected here, nor horns, the beasts being not come to their growth. But
that there may be some resemblance of the Sun, they place the chief bones
of the sacrifice upon the table in a circle.</p>

<p>Besides these 3 principal Gods they have some petty ones, as the Manes
of deceased men, and the <i>Julii</i> troops. They have no particular names for
the Ghosts, but call them all <i>Sitte</i>: neither do they erect them images as
they do to <i>Thor</i> and <i>Storjunkar</i>; only they offer them some certain sacrifices.
At which time their first business is to enquire the will of the dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
whether it please him to be worshipt with that kind of sacrifice in these
words, <i>Maijke werro Jabmike sitte</i>, <i>ô you Manes what will you have</i>, then
they beat the drum, and if the ring falls upon any creature there pictured
they take it for the sacrifice which the ghost desires: they then run thro
his ear, or, as others say, ty about his horns a woollen black thred. Having
performed the sacrifice, they spend all the flesh upon their own uses; except
a bit of the heart, and another of the lungs: each of which they divide into
3 parts, and fasten them upon as many sticks, which they dip in the blood
of the sacrifice, and so bury them in a kind of Chest made in the form of
a Laplandish Dray, as they do the bones of all other sacrifices. But of this
I shall speak more at large when I come to their funeral rites, where the
same things are likewise used. I shall only add that these rites are still observed
in <i>Lapland</i> by all that are superstitiously given. The <i>Juhlii</i>, whom
they call <i>Juhlafalket</i>, as I said of the ghosts, have no statues, nor images;
the manner of worshipping them is in this sort. The day before the festival,
which is Christmas day, they abstain from all flesh: and of every
thing that they eat, they take a litle piece and preserve it very carefully,
which they do likewise the next day. In their feasting, the bits which they
have gathered in these two days they put into a chest, made of the bark of
Birch, in the fashion of a Boat with sails and oars, together with some fat
of the pottage, and hang it upon a tree behind the Hut, about a bows
shot off, for the <i>Juhlii</i> to feast on, whom they then suppose to wander in
troops in the Air, thro woods and mountains; a ceremony not unlike to
the ancient libations to the <i>Genii</i>. But why they do this in a Boat they can
give no reason: but we may conjecture that hereby is intimated how the
knowledg of Christs-birth (declared by the Company of Angels, which as
I have shewed already was the meaning of these <i>Juhlii</i>) was brought by
Christians, who came to them in Boats. So much of the <i>Laplanders</i> Idolatry
and Superstition, which remains to this day amongst many of them, as is
found by daily experience.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the magicall Ceremonies of the</i> Laplanders.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">It hath bin a received opinion among all that did but know the name
of the <i>Laplanders</i>, that they are People addicted to Magic, wherefore
I thought fit to discourse next of this, as being one of the greatest of their
impieties that yet continues among them. And that this opinion may seem
to be grounded upon some autority, they are described both by ancient
and modern Writers, to have arrived to so great skill in enchantments,
that among several strange effects of their art, they could stop ships when
under full sail. This judgement of the Historians concerning the <i>Laplanders</i>
is no less verified also of the <i>Biarmi</i> their predecessours. So that we may
justly suppose both of them to have descended from the same original: for
the <i>Biarmi</i> were so expert in these arts that they could either by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
looks, words, or some other wicked artifice, so ensnare and bewitch men,
as to deprive them of the use of limbs and reason, and very often bring
them into extreme danger of their lives. But tho in these latter times they
do not so frequently practise this, and dare not profess it so publicly as before,
being severely prohibited by the King of <i>Sweden</i>: yet there are still
many that give themselves wholly unto this study. But if we enquire into
the motives and reasons hereof, this, formerly mention’d, seems the
principal, that every one thinks it the surest way to defend himself from
the injuries and malicious designs of others: for they commonly profess
that their knowledge in these things is absolutely necessary for their own
security. Upon which account they have Teachers and Professors in this
science: and parents in their last will bequeath to their children, as the
greatest part of their estate, those spirits and devils that have bin any waies
serviceable to them in their life time. <i>Sturlesonius</i> writes of <i>Gunilda</i>, a maid,
that was sent by her father <i>Odzor Huide</i>, who dwelt in <i>Halogaland</i>, to
<i>Motle</i> King of <i>Finlapland</i> in <i>Norway</i>, to be instructed in this art. Where
he gives an account also of two other <i>Finlanders</i>, and the great knowledg
they attained to in this profession. But it is very seldom that the parents
themselves are not so learned, as to perform the duty, and save the expences
of a tutor. Thus they become famous in these studies, especially when they
happen to be apt Schollars. For as the <i>Laplanders</i> do not all agree in the
same disposition, so neither do they arrive to the same perfection in this
art. For some are so stupid and dull, that however they may seem qualified
for other emploiments, they prove altogether unfit for this.</p>

<p>As to the bequeathing their familiars to their Children, they suppose it
the only means to raise their family; so that they excell one another in
this art, according to the largeness of the legacies they receive. From
hence it is manifest, that each house hath peculiar spirits, and of different
and quite contrary natures from those of others. And not only each distinct
family, but single persons in them also have their particular spirits, sometimes
one, two, or more, according as they intend to stand on the defensive
part, or are maliciously inclined and design to be upon the offensive: so that
there are a set number of obsequious spirits, beyond which none hath. But
however some of these will not engage themselves without great solicitation,
and earnest entreaties, when others more readily profer themselves to litle
children, when they find them fit for their turn, so that diverse of the Inhabitants
are almost naturally Magicians. For when the devil takes a liking
to any person in his infancy, as a fit instrument for his designs, he presently
seases on him by a disease, in which he haunts them with several
apparitions, from whence according to the capacity of his years and understanding
he learns what belongs to the art. Those which are taken thus
a second time see more visions, and gain greater knowledg. If they are
seased a third time, which is seldom without great torment, or utmost
danger of their life, the devil appears to them in all his shapes, by which
they arrive to the very perfection of this art; and become so knowing, that
without the Drum they can see things at greatest distances, and are so possessed
by the devil, that they see them even against their will. For example,
not long since a certain <i>Lap</i>, who is yet alive, upon my complaint against
him for his Drum, brought it to me; and confest with tears, that tho he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
should part with it, and not make him another, he should have the same
visions he had formerly: and he instanc’t in my self, giving me a true and
particuliar relation of whatever had happened to me in my journy to <i>Lapland</i>.
And he farther complained, that he knew not how to make use of his
eies, since things altogether distant were presented to them.</p>

<p>As for the art, it is, according to the diversity of the instruments they
make use of in it, divided into two parts: one comprehends all that to
which their Drum belongs, the other those things to which knots, darts,
spells, conjurations, and the like refer. First concerning the drum, as being
peculiar to the <i>Laplanders</i>; and called by them <i>Kannus</i>, or <i>Quobdas</i>; it is
made out of a hollow piece of wood, and must either be of pine, fir,
or birch tree, which grows in such a particular place, and turns directly
according to the Suns course; which is, when the grain of the wood, running
from the bottom to the top of the tree, winds it self from the right
hand to the left. From this perhaps they believe this tree very acceptable
to the Sun, which under the image of <i>Thor</i> they worship with all imaginable
devotion. The piece of wood they make it of, must be of the root cleft
asunder, and made hollow on one side, upon which they stretch a skin: the
other side, being convex, is the lower part, in which they make two holes,
where they put their fingers to hold it. The shape of the upper side is oval,
in diameter almost half an ell, very often not so much; it is like a kettle
drum, but not altogether so round, nor so hollow; neither is the skin
fastned with little iron screwes, but wooden pegs. I have seen some sowed
with the sinews of Rain-dears. <i>Olaus</i> termed the drum very improperly an
anvil, tho I believe he only meant by this a drum, as will appear hereafter.
This perhaps made the Engraver mistake, who made a Smith’s anvil
for it, placing a Serpent and a frog upon it, with a Smith’s hammer by.
The <i>Laplanders</i> use only a drum, which perhaps because they beat it with
a hammer, was by <i>Olaus</i> called an anvil. They paint upon the skin several
pictures in red, stained with the bark of an Alder tree. They draw near
the middle of the drum several lines quite cross, upon these they place those
Gods, to whom they pay the greatest worship, as <i>Thor</i> the chief God, with
his attendance, and <i>Storjunkar</i> with his: these are drawn on the top of the
line; after this they draw another line parallel to the former, only half
cross the drum, on this stands the image of Christ with some of his Apostles.
Whatever is drawn above these two lines represents birds, Stars, and
the Moon; below these they place the Sun, as middlemost of the Planets,
in the very middle of the drum, upon which they put a bunch of brazen
rings when they beat it. Below the Sun they paint the terrestrial things,
and living creatures; as Bears, Wolves, Rain-dears, Otters, Foxes, Serpents:
as also Marshes, Lakes, Rivers, <i>&amp;c.</i> This is the description of the
drum according to <i>Sam. Rheen</i>, of which this is the picture.</p>

<p>I have observed that severall of their drums have not the same pictures
upon them, I have three very different; one, which is here set down,
marked by the letter B. They are described differently by <i>Tornæus</i>, in w<sup>ch</sup>
the figures are distinguished so as to refer to several places, of which there
are chiefly three. In the first stands <i>Norland</i>, and other Countries of <i>Sweden</i>,
which are placed on the South side of the drum, and are separated by a line
from the rest; in this also is contained the next great City, where they
trafic most; as in the drums made at <i>Torne</i>, or <i>Kiemi</i>, there is drawn the
City <i>Torne</i>, with the Temple, Priest, and Governour of the <i>Laplanders</i>,
and many others with whom they have any concerns: as also the highway
that lies betwixt them and <i>Torne</i>, by which they discover when their
Priest, or Governour will come; besides other affairs managed in those
parts. On the North part, <i>Norway</i> is described with all that is contained
in it. In the middle of these two stands <i>Lapland</i>, this takes up the greatest
part of the drum: in it are the several sorts of beasts that are in the Countrey,
here they picture herds of Rain-dears, Bears, Foxes, Wolves, and all
manner of wild beasts, to signifie when, and in what place they may find
them. If a tame Rain-dear be lost, how they may get him againe. Whether
the Rain-deers young ones will live. Whether their net fishing will be successfull.
If sick men will recover, or not. Whether women great with
child shall have a safe delivery. Or such, or such a man will die of such
a distemper, or by what other; and other things of the like nature which
they are desirous to know. I cannot give an account of the reason for this
difference in the drums, unless it is that some of them are made for more
malicious designs, others again for each man’s private purpose. Upon
this account I believe, according to the nature of the business they intend,
they add, and blot out, and sometimes wholly change the figures. But that
you may the better understand the diversity of the drums, here are two
represented to you, both which I had out of the Study of the Chancellour
of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Now there are two things required to fit the drum for use, an Index
and a Hammer, that shews among the pictures the thing they enquire after,
with this they beat the drum. The Index is the bunch of brazen rings
mentioned before. They first place one great ring upon the drum, then
they hang severall small ones upon that; the shape of the Index’s is very
different, for of these I have one made of copper, of the bigness of a
<i>Dollar</i>, with a square hole in the middle, several small chains hanging
about it instead of rings. Another hath an Alchymy ring, on which a
small round plate of copper is hung by little chains. I have seen another
also of bone, in the shape of the Greek Δ, with rings about it; and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of a quite different make. I have described mine under the drums A, and
B, by the mark G; but the common sort of rings are of copper, and those
upon the Chancellors drums are altogether such. Some writers call these
rings serpents, or brazen frogs, and toads, not that they resemble them,
but because by them they signifie these creature, whose pictures they
often use in their conjuring, as supposing them very grateful and acceptable
to the Devil. The <i>Laplanders</i> call the Index <i>Arpa</i>, or <i>Quobdas</i>;
and make it indifferently of any sort of metal. The hammer they use in
raising their familiars, is not the Smith’s; which was the errour of him
that drew it in <i>Olaus Magn.</i> but is an instrument belonging only to the
<i>Laplanders</i>, and called by a peculiar name by them: it is made of a Rain-deers
horn, branching like a fork, this is the head of the hammer, the
other part serves for the handle. The instrument is placed under the two
drums A. B. with the letter H, with the hammer they beat the drum, not
so much to make a noise, as by the drumming to move the ring lying on
the skin, so as to pass over the pictures, and shew what they sought after.
This is the description of the drum, with all its necessaries as it is used
by the <i>Laplanders</i> that are subject to the <i>Swedes</i>; the <i>Finlappers</i> also that
are under the Crown of <i>Danemarke</i>, make use of drums something different
in fashion from the former; yet however the difference is so small,
that I believe their drums are not of a different kind from ours, but made
only for some particular uses. I shall give an account of one of those, described
in <i>Wormius</i>’s Study, who saies that “the <i>Laplanders</i> drum, which
they use in their magic, and by beating which they discover those things
they desired, is made of an oval piece of wood hollowed, in length a foot,
in breadth ten inches; in this they make six holes, and put a handle to
it, that they may hold in the left hand, whilst they beat it with the other;
upon it they stretch over a skin, painted with diverse rude figures, drawn
with blood, or red; upon this lies a piece of brass, in the shape of a Rhomboides,
somewhat convexe, about two inches in diameter, in the middle
of this, and at each corner hangs a small chain. The instrument, with which
they beat the drum, is of bone, six inches long, about the thickness of
a little finger, and made much like the Latine T.”</p>

<p>This instrument the <i>Laplanders</i> use for diverse designs, and are of opinion
that whatever they do it is don by the help of this. For this reason
they have it in great esteem and reverence, taking such care in securing it,
that they wrap it with the Index, and hammer, up in a Lambskin, and
for its greater safety, lay it in some private place. But I think it an
errour, to suppose them to lay it in a Lambskin: for it is written in some
places <i>Loomskin</i>, which signifies the skin of a bird that lives altogether in
the water. They think it so sacred, and holy, that they suffer no maid
that is marriageable to touch it; and if they remove it from place to place,
they carry it the last of all, and this must be don too only by men; or else
they go with it thro some untrod way, that no body may either meet
or follow them. The reason they give for their great care in this particular,
is, because they believe if any one, especially a maid that is marriageable,
should follow the same way, they would in three daies time at least
fall into some desperate disease, and commonly without any hopes of recovery.
This they seem to verifie by many examples, that we may give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
more credit to it; and we have the less reason to doubt the truth of this,
since the devil severely commands his worship to be observed, and suffers
not those rites and customs he hath imposed to be violated, so long as
God is pleased to grant him this liberty. Now because it may happen sometimes
that a woman may out of necessity be constrained to go that way,
by which the drum hath bin carried, the devil is so favorable as to permit
it without any danger, upon condition she first offers a brazen ring to the
drum.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 579px;">
<a id="i_t055"></a>
<a href="images/zill_t055h.jpg">
<img src="images/zill_t055.jpg" width="579" height="800" alt="drum" />
</a>
</div>

<p>In the next place, because they believe they can effect very strange
things by the drum, we will shew what they are, and the manner used
to perform them. These are three, belonging either to their hunting, their
sacred affairs, or lastly the enquiring into things far distant. I find four
chiefly mentioned by another Writer, the first is, the knowing the state
of affairs in forreign Countries. The second, what success their designs in
hand will meet. With the third, how to cure diseases. The fourth, what
Sacrifices their Gods will be pleased to accept, and what beast each God
desires or dislikes most. As to the way in making enquiries, it is not the
same among all these artists. But the great thing they generally observe,
is, to stretch the skin very stiff, which is don by holding it to the fire.
The next is, that they beat not altogether in the same place, but round
about the Index; then that they beat softly at first, presently quicker, and
continue this till they have effected their intent. The drummer first lifts
up the drum by degrees, then beats softly about the Index, till it begins
to stirr, and when it is removed some distance from its first place to either
side, he strikes harder, till the Index points at something, from whence
he may collect what he sought for. They take care also that as well he that
beats the drum, as those that are present at the ceremony, should be upon
their knees. As to the occasions of their beating thus, the later of those
is already discoursed of. Now we proceed to the rest, the first of which is
concerning their enquiries into things acted in remote parts. Those who
desire to know the condition of their friends, or affairs abroad, whether
distant five hundred, or a thousand miles, go to some <i>Laplander</i>, or <i>Finlander</i>
skilfull in this art, and present him with a linen garment, or piece
of silver, as his reward, for satisfying them in their demands. An example
of this nature is to be seen upon record, at <i>Bergen</i>, a famous Market Town
in <i>Norway</i>, where the effects of the German Merchants are registred; in
this place there was one <i>John Delling</i>, Factor then to a <i>German</i>, to whom
a certain <i>Finlapper</i> of <i>Norway</i> came with <i>James Samaousuend</i>: of him <i>John
Delling</i> enquired about his Master then in <i>Germany</i>; the <i>Finlapper</i> readily
consenting to tell him, like a drunken man presently made a great bawling,
then reeling and dancing about several times in a circle, fell at last upon the
ground, lying there sometime as if he were dead, then starting up on a
suddain, related to him all things concerning his Master, which were afterwards
found to agree to what he reported. There are many more instances
of this kind: the most considerable, is one concerning a <i>Laplander</i>, now
living, who gave <i>Tornæus</i> an account of the Journey he first made to <i>Lapland</i>,
tho he had never seen him before that time; which, altho it was true,
<i>Tornæus</i> dissembled to him, least he might glory too much in his devilish
practises, and rely upon them, as the only means whereby he might attain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to truth. The autority of this man is so considerable, that it may gain credit
enough to the Story. As to the method taken in making discoveries, it
is very different. <i>Olaus Magn.</i> describes it thus, the drummer goes into
some private room, accompanied by one single person, besides his wife,
and by beating the drum moves the Index about, muttering at the same time
several charms, then presently he falls into an extasie, and lies for a short
time as if dead; in the mean while his companion takes great care, that no
gnat, flie, or other living creature touch him; for his Soul is carried by
some ill <i>Genius</i> into a forreign Countrey, from whence it is brought back
with a knife, ring, or some other token, of his knowledg, of what is done
in those parts; after this rising up, he relates all the circumstances belonging
to the business that was enquired after; and that they may seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
certainly so, he shews what he hath brought from thence. <i>Petr. Claud.</i> makes
no mention either of the drum, charms, company, or those things he brings
with him; but saies he casts himself upon the ground, grows black in the
face, lying as if dead for an hour or two; according as the distance of the
place is, of which he makes enquiry;
when he awakes he gives
a full account of all affairs there.
It is clear from what was said
before, that they made use of a
drum; and ’tis observed that for
this sort of conjuring the lower
part of the drum, whereby they
hold it, was commonly shaped
like a cross. One of this make
was given me by the Lord <i>Henry
Flemming</i>, Colonel of a foot Regiment
in <i>Finland</i>, the Figure of
it is in the page foregoing. They
hang about it several claws, and
bones of the creatures they take.
That several persons also, as
well men as women, are permitted
to be present at this ceremony,
is asserted by <i>Sam. Rheen</i>
in his history, where he saies
that the drummer sings a song,
called by them <i>Joiike</i>, and the
men and women that are present
sing likewise, some in higher
some in lower notes, this they
call <i>Duura</i>. Next as to the casting
themselves on the ground,
there are various relations, some
think them not really, but only
in appearance dead; others are
apt to believe that the soul departs
from the body, and after
its travell abroad, returns again.
But without doubt this is false,
for is it impossible, for either
man, or devil, to restore the soul
to the body it hath once left. So
that I believe the devil only
stifles the faculties of the soul for
a time, and hinders their operations. Now after the drummer falls down,
he laies his drum as near as possibly on his head, in this posture.</p>

<p>Those in the mean time that are present, leave not off singing all the
time he lies sweating in this agony; which they do not only to put him in
mind, when he awakes, of the business he was to know; but also that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
might recover out of this trance, which he would never do, (as they imagine) if
they either ceased singing, or any one stirred him with their hand or foot.
This perhaps is the reason why they suffer no flie, or any living creature
to touch him; and it is upon this account only that they watch him so diligently,
and not out of any fear they have least the devil should take away his
body; which opinion of <i>Peucers</i> is altogether false. It is uncertain how long
they lye in this manner, but it is commonly according as the place where
they make their discovery, is nearer or farther off; but the time never exceeds
24 houres, let the place be at never so great a distance. After he
awakes he shews them some tokens to confirm their belief in what he tells
them. This is the first and chiefest use they make of the drum.</p>

<p>The next is, how to know the event of their own concerns, and what
success their hunting will have, or any other business which they undertake,
for they seldom venture on any thing, without first consulting that.
In order to the knowing this, they place the bunch of rings on the picture
of the Sun in the drum; then they beat, singing at the same time;
if the rings go round towards the right hand, according to the Suns course
they promise to themselves good health, fortune, and great encrease both
of men and beasts; if contrary, towards the left, they expect sickness and
all the evils attending on ill success. We may easily ground this opinion of
theirs upon the other mentioned above, where they believe the Sun the only
Author of all productions. Wherefore when the Index moves according
to his motion, it portends prosperity by following his course, from whom
they expect all the good they receive. This is the way they take in all
their more weighty affairs, as in a journey, hunting, removing their habitations,
or any such like thing, of which something before, and more
hereafter. Before they hunt they make particular observation which way
the Index turns, whether East, West, North, or South; and collect from
thence where their game lies. Other things for which the drum is serviceable,
are, first, the discovering the nature of diseases, whether they
arise from any disorder in the body, or are caused by magic; this being
known, then to find the remedy for them, which is commonly by sacrifice
to one or other of their angry Gods, but chiefly to <i>Storjunkar</i>, who
bears greatest autority among them, and if not appeased, leaves them small
hopes of recovery. Wherefore the sick person vows a sacrifice, either of a
Rain-deer, Bull, Goat, or Ram, or something of this kind to one of the
<i>Storiunkars</i>, that stands upon the mountains. The sacrifice is not left to
the disposal of the sick man, but must be made according to the directions
of the drummer; for he is supposed to be the only man able to advise them
in this case, he first discovers which of the Gods is displeased, and what
sort of sacrifice is most acceptable to him, for they refuse several, and the
same also at several times. But before the drummer appeases their Gods,
they give him a copper and a silver ring, putting them on his right arm,
then he begins a song, and beats the drum, and all that are present joyn
with him in a <i>Chorus</i>; after this according to the place, to which the Index
points, he directs them. These are the things commonly done by the drum.
The last thing for which they think it necessary, is, the accomplishing their
wicked designs, as impairing mens health, or depriving them of their lives;
which is frequently enough practised among them, tho not altogether so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
publicly as heretofore. Some of them account this only unlawful, and exclude
themselves out of the number of those, which use it, thinking the other
uses of the drum to consist chiefly in doing good. But however this mischievous
Art continues still too much among them. Several inhabitants of <i>Kiema</i> in
<i>Lapland</i> were apprehended in the year 1671, with drums, for this purpose
so large, that they could not be removed from thence, but were burnt in
the place. Among those <i>Laplanders</i> there was one four score years of age,
that confessed he was bred up in this art from his childhood, who in 1670
upon some quarrell about a pair of mittens, caused a Boar of <i>Kiema</i> to
be drowned in a Cataract, for which he was condemned to die, and in order
to that was to be carried in chains to the next town in <i>Bothnia</i>, but in the
journy he contrived so by his art, that on a suddain, tho he seemed well,
and lusty, he died on the sledge, which he had often foretold he would
sooner do, then fall into the Executioners hands. As to the ceremonies
used in this particular, either in their words, gesture, or any other thing,
I can give no account, finding none in those writings, from whence I collected
the rest. The reason for this, I suppose, is, because they themselves
keep this secret, as the great mystery in their art; or that no one would
enquire into them, least they should be thought guilty of this damnable sin.</p>

<p>Having treated largely of the drum, we come to the other parts of this
art, to which also belong proper sorts of instruments: the first is a cord
tied with knots for the raising of wind. They, as <i>Zeiglers</i> relates it, tye
three magical knots in this cord; when they untie the first, there blows
a favorable gale of wind; when the second, a brisket; when the third, the
Sea and wind grow mighty stormy, and tempestuous. This, that we have
reported concerning the <i>Laplanders</i>, is by <i>Olaus Magnus</i>, and justly, related
of the <i>Finlanders</i>, who border on the Sea, and sell winds to those
Merchants that trafic with them, when they are at any time detained by a
contrary one. The manner is thus, they deliver a small rope with three
knots upon it, with this caution, that when they loose the first, they
shall have a good wind, if the second, a stronger, if the third, such a
storm will arise, that they can neither see how to direct the ship, and avoid
rocks, or so much as stand upon the decks, or handle the tackling. No other
Writers mention this concerning the <i>Laplanders</i>, and I am apt not to
think it at all probable, since they live in an inland Country, bordering
no where upon the Sea. Wherefore this properly belongs to the <i>Finlappers</i>
in <i>Norway</i>. Now those that are skilled in this art, have command chiefly
over the winds that blew at their birth; so that this wind obeys principally
one man, that another, as if they obtained this power when they first
received their breath; now as this belongs chiefly to the <i>Finlappers</i> and
<i>Finlanders</i> of <i>Norway</i>, so doth the stopping of the course of ships, which
is altogether of the same nature. This is also attributed to the <i>Laplanders</i>,
who according to the different affection they have for Merchants, make
the Sea either calmer, or more tempestuous.</p>

<p>We come now to their magical Darts, which they make of lead, in length
about a finger; by these they execute their revenge upon their enemies,
and according to the greatness of the injury received, they wound them
with cankrous swellings, either in the arms, or legs, which by the extremity
of its pain, kills them in three daies time. They shoot these darts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to what distance they please, and that so right too, that they seldom miss
their aim. <i>Olaus Magnus</i> reports the same in his writings, which I believe
is only a transcript of <i>Zeigler</i>’s, the words being the same, and without
doubt he follows him in this particular as he hath in many others. But I
suppose they are both mistaken, and misrender’d them leaden darts, since
I can find no person in these times that knows of any such; neither is there
any mention made of them in any other writers, or by the common People,
who seldom omit such circumstances as these in their relations. But they
might perhaps be mistaken in supposing them to be made of lead, by misunderstanding
the word <i>Skott</i>, which is commonly used for their explanation.
For when either man or beast is suddainly taken with a disease,
by which their strength fails, and they immediately perish; the common
People call this that takes them so <i>Skott</i>, that is a dart. This might make
<i>Zeigler</i> think to be really some dart, which the inhabitants are wholly
ignorant of, and most among us believe these things to be effected by some
other means. <i>Petrus Claudius</i> calls it a <i>Gan</i>, which they send abroad: he likens
it to a flie, but saies it is some little devil, of which the <i>Finlanders</i> in
<i>Norway</i> that excell most in this art, keep great numbers in a leathern bag,
and dispatch daily some of them abroad. Of these he relates a story, that
happened in his time: an Inhabitant of <i>Helieland</i>, who is still alive, going
towards the mountains in <i>Norway</i> to hunt Bears, came to a cave under the
side of a hill, where he found an image rudely shapen, which was the Idoll
of some <i>Finlander</i>; near this stood a <i>Ganeska</i>, or magical satchel: he opened
this, and found in it several blewish flies crawling about, which they call
<i>Gans</i>, or spirits, and are daily sent out by the <i>Finlanders</i> to execute their
devilish designs. But he seems to intimate no more by this word <i>Gan</i>, then
that very thing which endangers mens health, and lives. For he saies that
these <i>Finlanders</i> cannot live peaceably, except they let out of their <i>Ganeska</i>
or <i>Gankiid</i>, which is the satchel, every day one of the <i>Gans</i>, that is
a fly or devil. But if the <i>Gan</i> can find no man to destroy, after they have
sent him out, which they seldom do upon no account at all, then he roves
about at a venture, and destroies the first thing he meets with; sometimes
they command it out to the mountains, to cleave rocks asunder: however
these conjurers will, for very trivial causes, send out their <i>Gan</i> to ruine
men. This word <i>Gan</i> signifies no more then what <i>Zeigler</i> meant by his
dart, for the term by which they express its going out is <i>de Skiuda deris
Gan</i>, that is, he as it were shoots out his <i>Gan</i> like an arrow, for <i>Skiuda</i>
is only proper to the shooting out of an arrow.</p>

<p>This is the third thing belonging to their magic, which they use as well
against one another as strangers; nay sometimes against those that they
know are their equals in the art. Of this kind there happened a notable
passage betwixt two <i>Finlanders</i>, one of which was called <i>Asbioern Gankonge</i>,
from his great knowledge in the art, the other upon some small
difference concerning their skill, or some such trifle, would have destroyed
<i>Asbioern</i>, but was still prevented by his too powerfull art, till at last finding
an opportunity, as <i>Asbioern</i> lay sleeping under a rock, he immediately
dispatcht away a <i>Gan</i>, that cleft the rock asunder, and tumbled it upon
him. This happened in the time of <i>Petrus Claud.</i> not long before he wrote
his History. Some of the Conjurers are contented only with the power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
expell that <i>Gan</i> out of men, or beasts, which others send. This is remarkable
among them, that they can hurt no man with their <i>Gan</i>, except they
first know his parents name.</p>

<p>Now all that the <i>Finlanders</i> and <i>Finlappers</i> of <i>Norway</i> effect by their
<i>Gan</i>, the <i>Laplanders</i> do by a thing they call <i>Tyre</i>. This <i>Tyre</i> is a round
ball, about the bigness of a wallnut, or small apple, made of the finest
hair of a beast, or else of moss, very smooth, and so light that it seems
hollow, its colour is a mixture of yellow, green, and ash, but so that the
yellow may appear most. I had one of these given me by M<sup>r</sup> <i>John Otto
Silverstroem</i>, Warden of the Colledge belonging to the metals, and Master
of the Mines at <i>Saltzburg</i> and <i>Frahlune</i>. This is the figure of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="i_t060"></a>
<img src="images/zill_t060.jpg" class="lores" width="400" height="400" alt="ball" />

</div>

<p>This <i>Tyre</i> they say is quickened and moved by a particular art; it is sold
by the <i>Laplanders</i>, so that he that buies it may hurt whom he pleases
with it. They do perswade themselves, and others, that by the <i>Tyre</i> they
can send, either Serpents, Toads, Mice, or what they please into any
man, to make his torment the greater. It goes like a whirlewind, and as
swift as an arrow, and destroies the first man, or beast, that it lights on,
so that it often mistakes. Of these we have too many instances in this time,
which are too long to insert here: having therefore done with all, or at
least the chiefest matters concerning their sacred, and superstitious rites,
or worship; we proceed to other affairs.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Government of the</i> Laplanders.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">We come now to their secular affairs, which are either public or
private: we will treat first of the public, to which belong the form
and constitution of their Government. This in former times, before they
were named <i>Laplanders</i>, was in this manner; they were subject to no neighbouring
Country, but were governed among themselves yet so as to be
subject to a King, they chose out of their own Nation. Most of them, or at
least those which bordered on <i>Norway</i>, and dwelt near the Sea, were under
this kind of Government, in the time of <i>Harauld Harfager</i> King of <i>Norway</i>,
cotemporary with <i>Ericus</i> the Conqueror, King of the <i>Swedes</i>, this
was 900 years after Christ; he conquered the greatest part of <i>Norway</i>,
except these <i>Finlanders</i>. The King that reigned over them at that time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was named <i>Mottle</i>. This account was questionless taken from <i>Haralds</i> expedition
into <i>Biarmia</i>, and his ruining all that Countrey, except the part
belonging to these <i>Finlanders</i>. In those times the name of <i>Laplanders</i> was
neither used, nor known, as I have shewn elsewhere, but they retained
that of their ancestours, which was also common to all of the same extraction.</p>

<p>Their condition was not much altered, after that they took this name;
which was when they first sent out Colonies into the inland Countries,
on the farther part of the mountains, which divide <i>Swedland</i> from <i>Norway</i>.
For they that went out had certainly some Leader, whom without doubt
they chose for King, after they had taken possession of those Countries; and
I believe they would scarcely submit to any other power whilst that he
was living; and this seems the more probable, because no one in those
daies would undertake the conquest of a company of poor beggarly fugitives,
who dwelt among Woods and Deserts, in continual snow and
the greatest extremity of cold. This was the <i>Moscovites</i> opinion of them,
who tho they dwelt near them, scarcely knew their nature and disposition,
and thought it madness to set upon them with a small party, and an adventure
of little profit, and less honour to raise an Army against a Country
already distressed by poverty. For this reason the <i>Laplanders</i> enjoied their
own customs for a long time. The first King of <i>Sweden</i> that had any thoughts
of conquering them was <i>Ladulaus</i> the great, who florished about the year
1277, who because it seemed difficult to bring them under the Crown of
<i>Sweden</i>, promised those that would undertake the conquest, the government
over them. He thought it too expensive to make a public war upon them,
when they were to be dealt with as wild beasts; yet however could not
endure that a neighbouring People, dwelling almost in the heart of his
Country, for they possessed at that time as far as the Bay of <i>Bothnia</i>,
should refuse obedience to his Kingdom. Wherefore he thought upon the
before mentioned project, and proposed great advantages to private persons,
upon which the <i>Birkarli</i>, their neighbours, readily engaged themselves,
and effected their enterprize no less successfully. In this design, the plot
of a particular person was most remarkable, as is related by <i>Ericus</i>,
and recorded by <i>John Buræus</i>. One single man of the <i>Birkarli</i> went towards
<i>Lapland</i> to way-lay the <i>Laplanders</i> in their return from <i>Birkala</i>,
(at this time no one inhabited on the North side of that allotment)
and ordered his wife to cover him over with snow, in the middle of the
way where the <i>Laplanders</i> must necessarily pass over him. They came in the
night time, and by their passing over him he knew there were fifteen,
which were the chief among them, and to whom the rest were in subjection;
when they were gone, he immediately arose out of the snow, and
going some shorter way, set upon them at unawares, as they passed by,
one by one, which is their usual way in travelling, and slew them one after
another. None of those that followed perceived the first men slain, it being
in the night time, and each of them at some distance from the others;
till the last man finding his fellows killed, made a stout resistance, but the
<i>Birkarla</i> by the assistance of his wife got the victory, and slew him likewise.
Thus the most powerfull of them being slain, the rest readily submitted.
Some think the <i>Birkarli</i> deluded them by a pretended truce, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that before it was expired, they assaulted them, not suspecting then the least
danger, and killing several, subdued the Countrey, as far as the Northern
and Western Oceans. We may easily collect from the truce mentioned
here, that before their subjection to the <i>Swedes</i> by the <i>Birkarli</i>, there
was some kind of war betwixt both: besides, it was shewn above, that
<i>Ladulaus</i> could not bring them under his Crown. This perhaps may be
<i>Zeiglers</i> meaning, when he describes them as a warlike People, and free
for a great time, that they also withstood the Arms of <i>Norway</i> and <i>Sweden</i>,
till they were forced at last to yeild; but what <i>Zeigler</i> imputes to their
valour, proceeded only from the contemt they were then in, as is plain
from the opinion the <i>Moscovites</i> gave of them. And there is little reason to
suppose the <i>Swedes</i> were not of the same, since they were overcome only
by the allotment of <i>Birkala</i>; and <i>Ladulaus</i> did not conquer them out of any
fear he conceived of their forces, but by sleight, foreseeing the small advantages
he should receive would not quit the charges of an Army. Thus
the <i>Laplanders</i> were brought in subjection by the subtilty and expence of
private persons. About the year of our Saviour 1277, the <i>Birkarli</i> had the
autority over them; yet so as to acknowledg their dependance on the
King of <i>Sweden</i>. Now whether all of them were thus overcome, as those
that lived beyond the mountains of <i>Norway</i>, near the Sea, which are the
<i>Finlanders</i>, or <i>Lappofinni</i>, is still in doubt, except we collect it from this,
that all from the Northern and Western Oceans were certainly subjected.
But whatever dispute may arise concerning that, it is manifest the <i>Swedes</i>
were the first Conquerours of <i>Lapland</i>, but afterwards the <i>Norwegians</i> and
<i>Moscovites</i> following their example, put in also for a part; thus they
became subject to these three severall Princes. But to pass by the others,
the <i>Swedes</i> enjoyed, for some former ages, half the dominions from <i>Tidisfiorden</i>
to <i>Walangar</i>, over the <i>Lappofinni</i>, or maritime <i>Finlanders</i>. This
was given by <i>Charles</i> the IX, in his instructions to his Embassadors, sent
to the King of <i>Danemark</i>, wherein he made it appear that the <i>Swedes</i> had
from former times, till then, enjoied half the rights, both sacred and civill,
whether as to tributes, punishments, men, or fisherie, with the
Crowns of <i>Danemark</i> and <i>Norway</i>. But the <i>Swedes</i> kept only a third part
from <i>Malanger</i> to <i>Waranger</i>, those of <i>Norway</i> and <i>Moscovy</i> laying claim
to the other two, till in the year 1595, the <i>Moscovites</i>, by a League, delivered
up their part, but the <i>Swedes</i> alwaies possessed the mountainous
and more neighbouring places from <i>Ladulaus</i>’s time, for near four hundred
years, and exercised their autority over them. The Government after the
conquest was in the hands of the <i>Birkarli</i>, according to the grant given
them by <i>Ladulaus</i>, who ruled over those that dwelt near the Bay of <i>Bothnia</i>,
imposed taxes, trafficked with them, and received all the profit of
the Salmon fishing, and all other advantages arising from them; but in
acknowledgement to the King, as Supreme, they paid a certain number
of gray Squirrils skins. The <i>Laplanders</i>, by common consent, received
and honored the <i>Bergchara</i>, that is men of the mountains, or <i>Birkarli</i>, as
their Governours, and paid them very rich skins, and severall sorts of fish,
both for their tribute to the King of <i>Sweden</i>, and their own proper uses.
Neither were there any other commissioned by the King in those times to
govern them, as will appear afterwards. He, that was their Governor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
honored by them with the title of King, his autority was confirmed by
the Crown of <i>Sweden</i>, he wore a red robe, as the token of his Roialty;
now from this sort of garment, by which the <i>Birkarli</i> were distinguished
from others, it is evident they were the first rulers in those parts; and
perhaps only one governed them, whilst they dwelt near the Bay of <i>Bothnia</i>,
but when they enlarged their possessions farther into the Land, and
were divided into severall Counties, each division had its particular Governor.
And that it was so, is manifested from the Letters of <i>Gustavus</i> the
first, where he divides the <i>Birkarli</i> into <i>Luhlians</i>, <i>Pythians</i>, and <i>Tornians</i>,
over which accordingly there were severall Governors. It may perhaps
now be a dispute, who these <i>Birkarli</i> were, by whom the <i>Swedes</i>
subdued <i>Lapland</i>; <i>Buræus</i> saies they were the Inhabitants of the allotment,
of <i>Birkala</i>, but <i>Olaus Magnus</i> is of a different opinion, and calls them
<i>Bergchara</i>, that is, men of the mountains, from <i>Berga</i> mountain, and <i>Charar</i>
or <i>Karar</i> men. What grounds he hath for this, he neither declares, nor can
I easily imagine. But I think them so small that they will find little credit
any where; for from whence, or from what mountains should they be thus
called? not from those of <i>Norway</i>, when at that time no body inhabited
there; neither are there any other mountains besides these, from whence
they should take this name: moreover, the <i>Birkarli</i> were subjects to the
<i>Swedes</i>, and conversed commonly with the <i>Laplanders</i>. The public records
also contradict this opinion, for in them there is no mention of <i>Bergcharli</i>,
but <i>Birkarleboa</i>. It is yet clearer also from the Letters of <i>Cnute Joanson</i>,
written in Latine, in the year 1318, where he saies in the Parliament
held at <i>Telge</i>, betwixt the <i>Helsingers</i> and <i>Birkarleboa</i> in his presence, there
was issued out this Placart, <i>&amp;c.</i> This serves to confute <i>Olaus</i>. It is more
evident that they came from <i>Birkala</i>, an allotment in <i>Tavastia</i>, and described
in the Mapps. Next, as to <i>Gustavus</i> the first mentioning the <i>Birkarli</i>, in
the foresaid Letters, as belonging to severall marches, <i>viz.</i> <i>Luhla</i>, <i>Pitha</i>,
and <i>Torna</i> it was upon this account: the <i>Birkarli</i> that descended from
those of <i>Tavastia</i>, were placed in these severall Towns to govern the <i>Laplanders</i>,
and because they only had the priviledge of commerce with them,
they were called Merchants. They were used in the Summer to buy those
commodities of the Merchants that came to <i>Bothnia</i>, which were necessary
for the <i>Laplanders</i>, and in the Winter, when the Rivers and Lakes were
frozen over, they carried them up into the Countrey. This way of trafic
was used by all the Inhabitants of <i>Bothnia</i>, but perhaps only at first by
one allotment, which growing populous, severall of the Inhabitants removed
farther into the Countrey, and retained the same priviledge that was first
granted by <i>Ladulaus</i>, <i>viz.</i> that no one, but they, should claim any priviledges
over the <i>Laplanders</i>, either as to the Government, tribute, commerce,
or any thing of this nature, which priviledges they for a long time
enjoied, as is confirmed by the Letters wrote by <i>Cnute Joanson</i>, in the
time of King <i>Smecke</i>, in which it was provided that the <i>Birkarli</i> should not
be molested either in their passage to or from the <i>Laplanders</i>. This priviledge
they maintained till <i>Gustavus</i> the first, who made a Contract with
them at <i>Upsal</i> on the 4<sup>th</sup> of <i>April</i> 1528, concerning the yearly tribute they
were to pay to the Crown, for the great advantages they received from
the <i>Laplanders</i>. This tribute was only in respect of the priviledges the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
<i>Birkarli</i> had from <i>Ladulaus</i>’s time till then, these were so largely granted,
that they setled them as hereditary upon their children, and none but
those descended from the <i>Birkarli</i> could enjoy them. This <i>Gustavus</i> also
confirmed according to the former grants made to their ancestors, but with
this alteration that they should pay half as much more, as they did formerly.
This Government the <i>Birkarli</i> exercised over the <i>Laplanders</i> which they got
by subtility, had their autority from the King of <i>Sweden</i>, preserved it in
their own family, and delivered it down to their children for near 300
years, till <i>Gustavus</i> the first, by reason of their insulting over the common
People, deprived them of this state; for when their riches encreased they
oppressed the poorer sort, and extorted so much from them that they left
them very little, but that which was worth nothing. Upon this, complaint
was made to <i>Gustavus</i>, who thereupon committed <i>Henricus Laurentii</i> to
prison, and confiscated most of his estate, taking then the tribute from the
<i>Laplanders</i> into his hands, and granted to all People free trading with
them. This <i>Henricus Laurentii</i> was without doubt in that time the head of
the <i>Birkarli</i>, and I believe the brother of <i>David Laurentii</i>, who, together
with <i>Jonas Nicolas</i>, concluded the Treaty with <i>Gustavus</i> in the name of
the <i>Birkarli</i>, in the year 1528, for setling the tribute, and other affairs.
From hence we may collect they lost their priviledges, not long after this
Contract; now it was not only just to deprive them of those priviledges,
which they abused in oppressing others, but prudent, as well from the
jealousy of too great a power granted to private persons over so large and
populous a part of the Kingdome, as out of consideration of its wealth,
which was more necessary to the Kings, for driving out the common enemy,
ane establishing the Kingdomes liberty, then to maintain the pride of the
<i>Birkarli</i>, who besides their injustice, were inconsiderable both in number
and strength. <i>Gustavus</i> the first having thus deposed the <i>Birkarli</i>, sent Deputies
to gather the tribute, and manage all things in the Kings name; the
Deputies are called by the <i>Swedes</i>, <i>Lappfougder</i>, by the <i>Laplanders</i>, <i>Konunga
Olmai</i>, that is the Kings men; of these there is mention made in the
patent granted by <i>Gustavus</i> the first to M<sup>r</sup> <i>Michael</i>, the first Priest in <i>Lapland</i>
in 1559, the words are to this purpose, <i>We commend all the Inhabitants
of</i> Lapland, <i>as well Deputies, as others</i>, &amp;c. These had at first the
charge of all public affairs, as will appear in the following Chapter, as
for collecting taxes, as executing justice among them. But afterwards, when
<i>Charles</i> the ninth divided the Countrey into several parts, and formed it
into better order, more were added to the former, for examining causes,
convicting of criminals, and other such like things, till at last the state of
Government was little different from what it is now. Next under the King,
they have a Provincial Judge called by the <i>Swedes</i>, <i>Lagman</i>, under him one
of the Senators, <i>Underlagman</i>, next an Interpreter of the Laws, <i>Laglæsaren</i>,
and divers others which enquire into causes, and do justice; then
they have a Governour of the Province, <i>Landzhœfdingh</i>, a head over the

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Judicatures and Tributes of the</i>
Laplanders.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">After the manner of their Government, and the discipline they
live under, we descend to those affairs that are managed by it; which
belong either to the Courts of Judicature, or to the Tribute. I can scarce
find any mention of the former. Their own Kings, when they were a free
Nation, exercised this autority, and kept the jurisdiction in their own
hands; but when the <i>Birkarli</i> ruled them, it depended altogether on their
plesure. <i>Zeigler</i> makes no mention of any Judges among them, but saies
that if any dispute happened that was dubious, it was referred to the Courts
in <i>Swedland</i>; I suppose he means the more weighty controversies, which the
<i>Birkarli</i> could not, or did not dare to decide. But these were very rare
with them, for great crimes, as theft, rapine, murder, adultery, or such
like are seldom committed and scarce known by the <i>Laplanders</i>. They
neither borrow nor lend mony, being content with what they possess of
their own, which are commonly the occasions of quarrels in other Nations,
and maintain so many Lawyers. The chief sin they are guilty of is their
magical superstition, which since their embracing Christianity, is forbidden
by the Laws, and is not so frequent as formerly. After that <i>Gustavus</i> the
first had deposed the <i>Birkarli</i>, and given them Governors of their own,
they lived under better discipline, and greater diligence was used in seeing
Justice done, but <i>Charles</i> the ninth was the first that took care to have
them instructed in the Swedish Laws, and that they should regulate themselves
accordingly. This charge was given by the same King in his instructions
to <i>Laurentius Laurentii</i>, Governor of <i>Lapland</i>, dated from <i>Stockholm</i>
on the 10<sup>th</sup> of Oct. 1610, wherein he commanded him to govern those of
<i>Uma</i>, <i>Pitha</i>, and <i>Luhla</i>, according to the Swedish Laws, and to protect them
from all injuries. There are at present in <i>Lapland</i> three Governors, and
as many Courts of Judicature: the first is called <i>Anundsiœense</i>, or <i>Angermansian</i>,
the other <i>Uhmensian</i>, <i>Pithensian</i> and <i>Luhlensian</i>, the other is the
<i>Tornensian</i>, and <i>Kiemensian</i>. Over these are particular Governors, who in the
Kings name pass Sentence, but in the presence of a Judge and a Priest;
where it is observable that they added Priests to the Governors, to restrain
them from doing injustice by the autority of their presence. Now as to
the time when these Courts were called, it is a doubt, but I believe it was
at the Fair times, when they met about all public business; this was commonly
twice in a year, <i>viz.</i> in Winter and Summer, according to an order
of <i>Charles</i> the ninth’s. It is now in <i>January</i> and <i>February</i>. They were held
in the same places where they kept their Markets and Fairs, which were
determined in each particular County, as will appear by and by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Now we come to the Tribute they paid, which at first was only skins
of beasts, paid not by the <i>Laplanders</i>, but the <i>Birkarli</i>, yet only as an acknowledgement
of their subjection to the Crown of <i>Sweden</i>. <i>Buræus</i> calls
it <i>naogra timber graoskin</i>, <i>graoskin</i> signifies gray Squirrils skins, of which
color the Squirrils were constantly in the Winter; <i>timber</i> denotes the number
of the skins, which were fourty, tied together in a bundle. It is uncertain
how many of these bundles the <i>Birkarli</i> gave, but in the Contract
with <i>Gustavus</i> the first, those of <i>Luhla</i> and <i>Pitha</i> were engaged to pay 8,
which makes in all 360 skins, besides two Martins skins. Those also of <i>Torne</i>
were taxed with the same number; and shortly after this number was doubled,
by an agreement made in 1528. But after the <i>Birkarli</i> had lost their priviledges,
for the forementioned reasons, and the King received the tax by
Commissioners for himself, it is very probable some more alteration were
made. In the year 1602 they paid instead of skins every tenth Rain-deer,
and one tenth of all their dried fish; which is clear from the commands
given by <i>Charles</i> to his Deputies <i>Olaus Burman</i> and <i>Henry Benegtson</i>, at
<i>Stockholm</i> on the 22<sup>d</sup> of <i>July</i> in the same year, to require the tribute in
this manner, that so the <i>Laplanders</i> might know what and how much they
were to pay: for it seems that from <i>Gustavus</i> the first’s time, till then,
the Governors used no constant method in raising it, but sometimes demanded
skins, at other times other sorts of goods that seemed most necessary
for present use; so that by this uncertainty the tribute grew very heavy
upon the Inhabitants, and their Governors took occasion from it to exact
what they pleased under pretence of the public account, for their own
proper uses. Yet this custom continued not long, being thought perhaps too
burthensome to the <i>Laplanders</i>, and very prejudiciable to their herds;
wherefore it was ordered in 1606, that every one which was then 17 years
of age, should pay either two Bucks, or three Does out of their herds of
Rain-deers, and eight pound of dried fish; as also every tenth Fawn out of
their stock, and every tenth tun from their fishery. This tax was also imposed
on the <i>Birkarli</i> that had any trafic with them. This order was kept
a long while, and renewed again by the same King in 1610. The tribute they
pay at this time is either mony, Rain-deers, or skins, either plain or fitted
up for use. These they pay according to the largeness of the Provinces in
which they dwell, the largest of which, they say, are <i>een heel skatt</i>, that
is, they pay the full tribute; the lesser <i>een half skatt</i>, that is, half tribute;
and so likewise for the rest. He that possesseth a Province of the whole tribute,
pays two <i>Patacoons</i>, which they call <i>Skattadaler</i>, and others that have
lesser possessions and half tribute, give one <i>Patacoon</i>; those which want mony,
pay fish or skins, which are commonly of Foxes or Squirrils, of these 50,
of the others one with a pair of <i>Lapland</i> shoes, are equal to a <i>Patacoon</i>:
two pounds also of dry fish are of the same value; now to every pound of
dried fish they allow five over, because so much is commonly lost in the
drying. They call this pound with its addition <i>Skattpund</i>, that is the pound
for tribute. They value their Rain-deers at 3 Dollars a piece, and pay the
tenths of them, not each family, but every hundred. I have set the prices
down here, because if any one had rather keep his Cattel, he can be forced
to no more then after this rate. Now concerning the tenths they pay of
skins, every housholder is taxed one white Foxe’s skin, or a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
<i>Lapland</i> shoes; if he hath neither of these, half a pound of dried Jack. This is
the Tribute yearly received by the Crown of <i>Sweden</i> from <i>Lapland</i>, of which
the greatest part is commonly by the Kings gracious favor allowed for
the maintenance of their Priests, as was shewn in another place. Now
because it is so far both by Sea and Land, before these commodities can
be brought to the Kings Storehouses, besides the ordinary tax they give
a pair of <i>Lapland</i> shoes, which they call <i>Haxapalka</i>, that is the price for
carriage. This is all they pay to the King of <i>Sweden</i>, but besides they are
tributary to the Crown of <i>Danmark</i>, and the great Duke of <i>Moscovy</i>, not
as Subjects to these Princes, but upon the account of their receiving several
advantages from their Dominions in their hunting and fishing. Those
that are thus, are all the allotments of <i>Torna</i> beyond the mountains, who
by reason of the liberty they have to bring down their Cattel from the
mountains into the vallies in the Summer time, near the Sea shore, and
taking the opportunity from thence of fishing, are taxed by the <i>Danes</i>, but
not at above half the rate that they pay to the <i>Swedes</i>. These allotments
are called <i>Koutokeine</i>, <i>Aujouara</i>, <i>Teno</i>, and <i>Utziocki</i>. The <i>Laplanders</i> also
of the allotment of <i>Enare</i> in <i>Kiemi</i>, are in the same condition, who for
fishing and hunting pay both to the <i>Danes</i> and <i>Moscovites</i> as well as to the
<i>Swedes</i>: to the first one half, to the other a third part of what the <i>Swedes</i>
receive. The tribute was in former time gathered when the Governor pleased,
but afterwards only in the Winter, against which time it was all brought
into Storehouses, each County having its proper place for that purpose.
But when the place for their Markets and Fairs was determined, the Governor
came thither and received it, which course they still take in this
business. That this was also the time for receiving it, will appear from the
account I shall give of their Fairs in the next Chapter.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the</i> Laplanders <i>Fairs, and Customs
in Trading.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">That we may not yet leave the Public concerns of the <i>Laplanders</i>,
of which we have treated, let us proceed in the next place to consider
their Fairs and common Markets, in which what Customs they anciently
used is not so well known. <i>Paulus Jovius</i> saies that among the <i>Laplanders</i>
he that had any thing to sell, after he had exposed his Wares, went his way
and left them, and that the Chapman coming, and taking what was for
his turn, left in the place the full value thereof in white furrs or skins.
The reason why they did not speak and bargain with their Chapmen, he
saies was, because they were a rustic People, extreamly fearful, and ready
to run away from the very sight of a ship, or stranger. Others, that are of
a more probable opinion, confess indeed that they used no words in their
trading, but that it was not out of rusticity, want of cunning, or the like;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
but because they had a language quite different from others, and so peculiar
to themselves, that they could neither understand, nor be understood of
their neighbours: so that it was rather the barbarism, and roughness of
their speech, then manners, that made them use this dumb way of traffiking.
But of their language we shall treat in its proper place.</p>

<p>Concerning their trading with their neighbours, it is most certain that
it was performed without words, by nods and silent gestures: neither was
it properly a buying and selling (for they did not of old use either gold
or silver) but rather an exchange of one commodity for another. So that
whereas <i>Zieglerus</i> tells us they did <i>permutatione &amp; pecunia commercia agere</i>,
we may justly doubt whether it be not rather to be read <i>nec pecunia</i>, (unless
happily he intend <i>pecunia</i> in the primary sense, and hath more respect
to the original of the word, then to the acception now in use.) And truly
this way of exchange among them, in those ancient times, was no less then
necessary; when indeed, as well the neighbouring Countries, as the <i>Laplanders</i>
were quite strangers to any current mony; and this we may understand
from the <i>Swedes</i>, among whom there were in those daies either no
coins at all; or else only such as had bin transported out of <i>England</i> and
<i>Scotland</i>, the use of the Mint being then utterly unknown in that Country.
And if at that time there was no mony in <i>Swedland</i>, it is certainly no great
wonder there should be none in <i>Lapland</i>. But neither in after times, and
when they were under the Jurisdiction of the <i>Birkarli</i>, could the <i>Laplanders</i>
come to the use of mony; for they that were Lords over them, monopolizing
the whole trade to themselves, did not give them mony for their commodities,
but such other merchandise, as their Country stood in need of.
In fine to this very day the <i>Laplanders</i> know no other mony but the <i>Patacoon</i>
and half <i>Patacoon</i>; other coins whether of copper, silver, or gold,
they do not so much value, which will give us to understand that the use of
mony among them cannot be of any long date, for the <i>Patacoon</i> is but of
later daies, and was never known before the discovery of the Mine in the
Vale of <i>Joachim</i>.</p>

<p>These <i>Patacoons</i> they value singly at 2 onces of silver a piece, whence it
appears that as they had no other mony, so neither did this pass currant
among them, but only by weight, and as if it were in the Mass: and I beleive
was not at all in use, untill they were forced to pay tribute in that
kind, of which I have discoursed before, and shewed that it was but of
late instituted. But what <i>Damianus</i> means by his <i>permutatione tantum annonam
&amp; pecuniam acquirunt</i>, we cannot so easily guess; for we do not say
that men barter and deal by exchange when mony is paid for a commodity:
for to what end should those People seek after getting mony, which was in
use neither among themselves nor their neighbours; so that perhaps here
also we ought to read <i>nec pecuniam</i>, and then the sense runs, that they were
not so sollicitous in getting mony, as in providing the more necessary things
of life: altho neither is that true which he delivers of their provisions, as
will appear from what follows.</p>

<p>But whatsoever <i>Damianus</i> means, it is most certain that in all their commerce
they did but exchange one thing for another; and that to this day the
same custom remains among them, who are now concern’d for no more mony
then what is sufficient to pay their tribute. Only if there is any commodity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
among them of great and extraordinary value, that indeed is to be bought
with mony.</p>

<p>Their custom is now, not as formerly, to bargain by signs and nods,
but either they use speech, (for there are many of them now that are
skilled in that of their neighbours) or Interpreters, of which there are
plenty enough among them. They with whom they trafic are for the most
part their neighbours, on the one side the <i>Swedes</i> and <i>Norwegians</i>, on the
other the <i>Finlanders</i>, <i>Russians</i>, and <i>Moscovites</i>. Neither was it otherwise
in old times, unless when they were under the power of the <i>Birkarli</i>, who
endeavouring to get all the trade into their own hands, did more narrowly
watch those that were nighest <i>Sweden</i>, that so they might exclude all but
themselves from trafficking in any part of <i>Lapland</i>. The power that we
read was given the <i>Birkarli</i> over the <i>Laplanders</i> by <i>Ladulaus</i> the great
King, I suppose, chiefly consisted in this; for the other speciall rights and
priviledges, which they and their ancestors for a long time possessed, <i>Gustavus</i>
the first hath set down, as I have in another place declared.</p>

<p>And this we may also gather from the prohibition of <i>Charles</i> the ninth,
denying the <i>Birkarli</i> the priviledge of trafficking in <i>Lapland</i>, as they had
formerly done. The words of the injunction published in the year 1602
are to this purpose; <i>And we do utterly forbid the</i> Birkarli <i>any more to trade
for skins or other commodities, as they have formerly used</i>. Before this time
therefore they were either the only, or chief Merchants in <i>Lapland</i>, whither
when they had brought their merchandise, they went round the Country
purchasing all the skins they could, of which afterwards they made great
sums of mony. And this they continually did till the time of <i>Gustavus</i> the
first, when that priviledge began to be denyed them; by which they were
grown so rich and powerfull, and what is the common consequent thereof,
proud and haughty.</p>

<p>But neither could <i>Gustavus</i> provide against all their arts and evasions;
for tho he took from them all power over the <i>Laplanders</i>, yet they being
better skilled in the commodities of the Country and constitution of the
People then others, did still, tho not so openly, keep correspondence and
trafic with them, till in the year 1602, in the time of <i>Charles</i> the ninth,
they were forbid by the forementioned injunction, at any time, or in any
place, to hold any commerce with them, and the monopoly of all skins was
annext to the Crown; a certain rate being set at which they were to be
sold. The words of the Edict are thus: “Whatsoever skins are found in
<i>Lapland</i>, we do command and enjoyn our Governors to buy up for our
use, according to the statute and rate in that case provided.” And this
was also again enforced in the year 1610, only in this there was a clause
inserted, that the skins of <i>Elkes</i> should be brought into the Kings tresury
<i>gratis</i>. The clause runs thus: “And we do command all <i>Laplanders</i> in our
name to bring to our Governors all saleable skins, for which they shall
return the worth in other commodities, as is by statute provided; but
the skins of <i>Elkes</i> they shall seize upon for our use, not giving any consideration
for them; if any man shall take this beast, it shall be lawfull
for him to keep the flesh for his own private use, but the skin shall
belong to Us and our Crown.” But their trading is now grown more
general, and they have of late years learned to deal more freely and openly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with other Nations; for they that dwell among the mountains that divide
<i>Norway</i> and <i>Swedland</i>, deal both with the <i>Norwegians</i> and <i>Swedes</i>, and they
that live more Northerly and Easterly with the <i>Russians</i> and <i>Finlanders</i>.</p>

<p>But I come to the commodities themselves, which <i>Jovius</i> saies are only
white skins, or furrs, called <i>Ermines</i>. <i>Zieglerus</i> reckons fishes also, of
which they have so great draughts, that they are forced to keep them in
trunks and ponds till they can transport them into <i>Northbothnia</i> and <i>Russia
alba</i>. But there are several other sorts of skins, which <i>Olaus Magnus</i> comprehends
under a more general term, and calls <i>pelles pretiosas</i>. <i>Sam. Rheen</i>
gives us this catalogue of them, the commodities of the <i>Laplanders</i> are, Raindeers,
skins of Raindeers, skins of black, yellow, blew, white Foxes; skins
of Otters, of <i>Gluttons</i>, or Badgers, of Martins, of Beavers, of Squirrils,
of Wolves, and of Bears, Laplandish garments, Boots, shoes, Gloves, dried
Pike, and Cheeses of Rain-deers. With these commodities the <i>Laplanders</i>
traffic for Silver, Patacoons, Wollen and linnen Cloth, Copper, Alchimy,
Salt, Corn, Bulls hides, Sulphur, Needles and Pins, Knives, Spirit
of Wine, and which is more strange for Tobacco, of which as I said before
they are great admirers.</p>

<p>Upon all these things as was but now declared, there was a certain rate
set by <i>Charles</i> the ninth, according to which they were to be bought up
for the use of the Crown; and the same custom is so far yet observed, that to
this very day, with whomsoever they deal, they have a certain estimate,
whereby they prize both their own and others commodities: the proportion
of which rates is according to the Patacoon, or which is the same thing
with them, 2 ounces of silver. For example, an ordinary Rain-deer they
value at 2 Patacoons, or 4 ounces of silver, the skin of a wild Rain-deer
at one Patacoon and &frac12;, or 3 ounces of silver; the skin of a tame male
Rain-deer at one Patacoon, but if castrated, at &frac14; of a Patacoon, and if a
female at &frac12;. So likewise an ordinary Fox skin is worth a Patacoon, 40 gray
colored Squirril skins are valued at the same price, which number of those
skins they call <i>timber</i>. The skin of a Martin at the same price, 3 white Fox
skins at the same price, a Bears skin is worth 2 Patacoons, and a Wolves
skin as much, an ordinary Laplandish garment, which they call <i>Mudd</i>,
is worth 3 Patacoons, a pair of Boots half a Patacoon, and 4 pair of shoes,
4 pair of gloves, and one pound of dried Pike, each of them are valued at
the same price.</p>

<p>Now on the other side, of the commodities for which they traffic, an
ell of ordinary cloth, commonly called <i>Silesian</i> or <i>Tangermyndense</i>, they
esteem at the rate of a Patacoon, or 2 ounces of silver; 3 pound of Copper
at the same rate, and one tunn of Corn at 2 Patacoons and &frac12;, or 5 ounces
of silver, 2 pound of Salt at &frac12; of a Patacoon, 10 yards of course cloth,
such as we call <i>home-spun</i>, and they call <i>Waldmar</i>, is worth a Patacoon,
a Can of spirit of Wine half as much; but if they chance to light upon any
commodities of a lower price, they value them by gray colored Squirril
skins, proceeding from one to 10, which number of skins they call <i>Artog</i>,
and value at &frac14; of a Patacoon, and these are the commodities that drive
the trade between the <i>Swede</i> and <i>Laplander</i>. But to those of <i>Norway</i> they
carry all sorts of coverlets, made of the skins of Rain-deers, also the beasts
themselves, their skins and cheeses, and the feathers of Birds; moreover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
those things for which they trade with the <i>Swedes</i>, are Copper and Alchimy
vessels, ordinary cloth woven by the Swedish Boors, these they change for
Bulls, and Cows, whose milk they live on in the Summer, and on their
flesh in the Winter, also for Goats and Sheep, out of whose skins they
make themselves coverlets, for silver, for the skins of black Foxes, and
Otters, for woollen blankets, and for fish, which they sell again to the
<i>Swedes</i>, as Herrings, dried Codfish, Skails, and such like. <i>Johannes Tornæus</i>
comprehends them in a shorter catalogue, the <i>Laplanders</i>, saies he,
traffic with those with <i>Norway</i> and <i>Bothnia</i>, Subjects of the Crown of
<i>Sweden</i>, for ordinary woollen cloth, linnen cloth of both sorts, as well the
finest as coursest, for corn, bread, brass, iron, and all sorts of Country
utensils. But above all things it was their chiefest care to get beasts out of
<i>Norway</i>, which in the Autumn, they used to Sacrifice to their Idols.</p>

<p>Whether there were anciently any set places or times in which they did
trade, I cannot certainly pronounce, tho <i>Olaus Magnus</i>, Lib. 4. Cap. 5.
seems to affirm it, and saies, there were certain set places, some in open
fields, and some upon the Ice, in which they did every year keep their
Fairs, and exhibit to the public view what they had by their own industry
gained, either at home or abroad. But for all this he proceeds not to tell
us where those Fairs were kept, or where those places were. And <i>Charles</i>
the ninth forbidding the <i>Birkarli</i> continually, and at all times to make
their circuits round the Country, did nevertheless appoint certain times
and places, in which, as at public Fairs, all traffic should be free and open
as well to them as others. The words of the Edict published in the year
1602 I will give you, which run thus: “Wherefore seeing we have forbidden
the <i>Birkarli</i> to trade in <i>Lapland</i>, according to their old custom,
and in manner aforesaid, We do will and command to be appointed two
Fairs every year in every Province, one in the Winter, the other in
the Summer, as it shall seem most convenient, and We do will and command
our Governors to take care that certain fit places be looked out, in
which these Fairs may be kept, and to appoint set times, at which most
conveniently as well all <i>Laplanders</i>, <i>Birkarlians</i>, <i>Moscovites</i>, as others, may
resort unto them. Furthermore our Will and pleasure is, that each Fair
last for two or three weeks, during which time, it shall be lawfull for
every one to make such bargains as may be most for his own profit. And
we do also command our Governors, that certain Boothes and Sheds be
provided after the most convenient manner.” Now by all this it may appear
that in former times there were no such things either observed or known,
seeing the King here speaks of them as first instituted by him; neither indeed
in the Edict it self doth he set down any certain time or place, but
names them only as things intended, and which he leaves to the discretion
of his Governors, which also <i>Andr. Buræus</i> seems to intimate was performed,
when he saies that when they were to pay their tribute, they were
at a certain time and in certain places gathered together, as into a <i>Store-house</i>,
where those Merchants, we before called <i>Birkarli</i>, exhibited their
wares. But now he also leaves us in the dark as to a certainty either of
time or place, so that it may seem these Fairs and constitutions did not
find so good success as it was hoped they would, untill at length the
Queen <i>Christina</i> taking the business into consideration, brought it to greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
perfection. There is an Edict of hers, published in the year 1640, in which
two Fairs are appointed, one at <i>Arfwisjerf</i> in <i>January</i>, the other at <i>Arieplog</i>
to be kept in <i>February</i>. The words are to this purpose: “Furthermore
We have given and granted, and by these presents do give and grant 2
solemn Fairs, one at <i>Arfwisjerf</i> on the Feast of the Conversion of S. <i>Paul</i>,
being the 25 of <i>Jan.</i> the other at <i>Arieplog</i> on the Feast of the Purification
of the B. V. <i>Mary</i>, being the 2<sup>d</sup> of <i>February</i>, each to be held for
3 daies, at which times it shall be lawfull for the <i>Pithenses</i> and all
<i>Laplanders</i> to exercise all sorts of traffic, and these Fairs shall first be
holden the next year 1641.” From this time they began to be more diligently
observed, and are kept upon those Feasts to this very day, for in all
Provinces there are every Spring 3 Fairs kept; the first in <i>Lapmarkia Umensis</i>
upon the Feast of the <i>Epiphany</i>, the 2<sup>d</sup> in <i>Lapmarkia Luhlensis</i> on the Conversion
of S. <i>Paul</i>, the last in <i>Lapmarkia Pithensis</i>, <i>Tornensis</i>, and <i>Kimensis</i> on
the Feast of the <i>Purification</i>. These are the Fairs which <i>Christina</i> instituted,
only that in <i>Umensis</i> I beleive was observed from the time of <i>Charles</i>
the ninth, and the rather because that <i>Lapmark</i> is nighest <i>Swedland</i>. Into
<i>Norway</i> they resort and keep Fairs twice a year, the first at Midsummer on
the Feast of S. <i>John</i>, the other in the Autumn on the Feast of <i>Simon</i> and
<i>Jude</i>, or <i>All-Saints</i> day. And so much for the times and places of their
Fairs.</p>

<p>As for their way of dealing they were of old in all their bargains very
faithfull and just, tho <i>Damianus à Goes</i> seems to note some craftiness in
them, and saies they were very cunning in all their tradings. And <i>Sam.
Rheen</i> in plain terms call them cheats, and saies they were so deceitful, that
one that did not know all their tricks, could hardly escape being over-reached
by them. So that we may suppose that as long as others dealt
fairly with them, so long they were trusty and faithfull, but in after times
coming to learn how others had served them, by understanding how they
had been cheated formerly, they themselves learned to deceive others.
But of this we have spoken before: and these thing may serve to give us
some light into their customs in trafficking.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Language of the</i> Laplanders.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">In the former Chapter we told you that the Language of the <i>Laplanders</i>
was such as did very much differ from that of their neighbours, our next
business shall be, as well as we can, to discover what it is. Now whatsoever
is received, used, commonly, and publikly spoken in any Country,
is certainly a Language, but of this of the <i>Laplanders</i>, <i>Zieglerus</i> in general
observes only that it was peculiar to themselves, and not understood by
their neighbours. <i>Damianus</i> speaks more plain, and accuses them of barbarism
and roughness of speech. Our modern Writers say their speech is a
confused miscellany of the Language of their neighbours, and that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
called <i>Lingua Lapponica</i>, quasi <i>corrasa</i>, <i>eet Lappatspraock</i>, and that it is made
up of many other Tongues, as of that of <i>Finlanders</i> and <i>Swedes</i>, as for
instance; the <i>Laplanders</i> say <i>stour</i>, the <i>Swedes</i>, <i>stoor</i>; the one <i>Salug</i>, the
other <i>saligh</i>. And that there are also some Latine words, as <i>Porcus</i>, <i>Oriens</i>,
&amp;c. But tho these Writers suppose that they have borrowed many words
from their neighbours, yet they confess that much of their Language is
their own, and neither used, or known by any other Naitons, but that as
well the original of the words, as propriety of the Phrases, is peculiar
to themselves. Others suppose it took its rise and was derived from <i>Finland</i>:
and indeed it is confessed on all hands that there are many words in
both Languages that seem no great strangers. So that there is little doubt
but there are many words in both Languages which very much agree, which
any one that is a little skilled in them must needs confess: and to make
this more clear, I shall here insert some words of both Languages not much
unlike.</p>

<p>These words I suppose may serve to declare the affinity that we said
was between the Language of the <i>Laplanders</i> and <i>Finlanders</i>: and because
the words that I have set down, do not signify any forreign commodities,
but things natural, and such as are in use among all People alike, I am given
to beleive that the <i>Laplanders</i> had not any peculiar Language, which did
wholy differ from that of <i>Finland</i>, but that it took its original thence. For
if, as some would have it, they had any Language, they might properly
call their own, why did they not out of it, upon things of so common occurrence
and ordinary use, rather impose their own words, then such as
no man could doubt were taken from the <i>Finlanders</i>. No People certainly
were ever guilty of so much folly as to impose forreign names upon so
common things, if they had any Language of their own to express them in:
as might be at large demonstrated from the Languages of the <i>Germans</i>,
ancient <i>Gaules</i>, <i>Spaniards</i>, <i>Italians</i>, <i>Greeks</i>, &amp;c. neither have we any reason
to count it a hard inference if we should from hence gather, that the <i>Laplanders</i>
themselves sprung from the <i>Finlanders</i>. For otherwise why should
they have used any other Language then what they received from their fore-Fathers.
And this seems to be the argument <i>Wexonius</i> uses to prove the
Language of the <i>Laplanders</i> to have taken its rise from the <i>Finlanders</i>, when
from the original of the People he infers the same of the Speech; for in this
he intimates that to spring from any Country, and to use the same Language,
are very convertible propositions. All which indeed seems to be no more
then the truth. But now some one may object that the opinion of those men
that affirm the Language of this Country to be primarily its own, could
not be destitute of all reason, and that they must necessarily have had some
probabilities whereon they grounded their opinion; and truly it cannot
be denied but that there are many words which do not any waies agree with
the Language of the <i>Finlanders</i>, as may appear from what follows,</p>

<p class="noindent">And the Difference between these and the like words without doubt was
that which gave occasion to some to think that anciently the <i>Laplanders</i> had
a Speech peculiar to themselves, and quite different from that of <i>Finland</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of which ancient Language these relicts did remain, and for this they give
this reason; that the <i>Laplanders</i> were forced to frame to themselves a new
Language, for fear, least being understood by their neighbours the <i>Finlanders</i>,
they should fall into their snares. So <i>Olaus Petri</i> saies that often times they
found spies about their tents in the night, hearkning after their Councels,
now for this reason, according to the Policy of their Forefathers, flying
into the allotment of <i>Rengo</i>, in the Province of <i>Nolnense</i>, they there agreed
upon, and framed to themselves a Speech quite different from that of <i>Finland</i>.
So that there are very few words found to agree in both Languages.
Now by the Spies he there talks of, he understands the <i>Finlanders</i>, who
being driven out of their Country by <i>Matthias Kurkius</i> and the <i>Tavastians</i>,
roved up and down, seeking where they might most conveniently settle,
as may appear from what goes before in that place. Others think that these
are the relicts of that Language which they first brought into <i>Lapland</i>, which
they suppose to be no other but that of the <i>Tartars</i>. But how false this is,
may appear from the vast difference between those Tongues, in which there
is not one word that signifies the same thing in both Languages. And that
you may not think I say this without any reason, I will give you a few
instances.</p>

<p class="noindent">And indeed there is as great incongruity in all the rest of the words as in
these, so that this opinion is not only foolish, but ridiculous. And neither
is the other, which pretends they framed a Language to themselves, grounded
upon any greater truth then this former. For first why should they only
have changed some words and not all? And then these words which do
agree in both Languages are not the names of things less known, or not
so ordinarily used, as other things, but of such as were as common as life,
light, or breathing: wherefore I am clearly of the other opinion, and do
beleive that these differing words are as much Finnonick as any of the rest.
But they who from the difference of these words infer the independency
of the Speeches, do not at all consider that, then which there is nothing
more common and incident to Languages, <i>viz.</i> to be changed and altered
according to the times, and so much the more by how much the People have
greater commerce with other Nations. And this is plain from the example
of the <i>Islanders</i> and <i>Norwegians</i>; for that the <i>Islanders</i> sprung from the
<i>Norwegians</i> is by the Histories of both Nations made so clear that no man
can doubt of it. But now the <i>Islanders</i> use many words which those of
<i>Norway</i> are quite ignorant of; and yet I hope no man will thence say that
the <i>Islanders</i> have a Language wholly independent and different from that
of <i>Norway</i>: for the one living by themselves, and having little or no dealings
with other People, do to this day keep entire the same Language which
they first brought, and which they received down from their ancestors: but
it was quite otherwise with the <i>Norwegians</i>, who together with their Empire
lost also their ancient Language. The same seems to be the case of the
<i>Finlanders</i>, who being brought under the Jurisdiction of others, and holding
more frequent commerce with their neighbours, lost much of their ancient
manner of speaking, which the <i>Laplanders</i> on the contrary living a more
solitary life, it is probable, do still keep uncorrupt. Wherefore it is no
wonder if in their language we meet with many words, which compared with
those of the modern <i>Finlanders</i>, seem to have nothing of likeness; tho
happily one that is well skilled in the dialect and propriety of the Finnonick
Language, will find enough to make him conjecture that there are
many words which, as they are now used seem quite different, yet are very
agreeable in the original. And this is likewise the common fate of other languages,
as for example of the <i>German</i>, in which a little too rashly the learned
<i>Olaus Wormius</i> in his <i>literatura Runica</i>, as he calls it, Cap. 27, hath taken
notice of so great a difference. For in these daies not only <i>nach</i>, but <i>effter</i>
is used, as may appear <i>affterred</i>, <i>afterdam</i> &amp;c. And so likewise the <i>Germans</i>
use not only <i>Gesicht</i>, but also <i>Antlitz</i>; not only <i>Verstand</i>, but <i>Vernunfft</i>;
and as well <i>essen</i>, <i>anfangen</i>, <i>Schuss</i>, <i>Alter</i>, <i>Gefængnus</i>, <i>auffthun</i>, <i>Bett</i>,
<i>Dopff</i>, &amp;c. as, <i>As</i>, <i>beginnen</i>, <i>keimen</i>, <i>uralt</i>, <i>haffte</i>, <i>entdecken</i>, <i>Lægerstad</i>,
<i>locken</i>, in all which they agree with the ancient <i>Germans</i>. In my opinion
therefore the difference of a few words, is not authority enough to prove
that the <i>Laplanders</i> in ancient times had a peculiar language. But it shews
rather that they are not all of the same antiquity, but that some came from
<i>Finland</i> longer ago, who brought those obsolete words with them, and some
of later daies, who now use the new; and this I think to be the best account
of the Language of the <i>Laplanders</i>. Of which this also is observable,
that it doth not in all places alike agree with it self, but hath its several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
different Dialects, and is so various, that those that live in one part of the
Country, can scarce understand those of the other. There are especially
three Dialects, the first used by the <i>Umenses</i> and <i>Pithenses</i> in the West,
the 2<sup>d</sup> by the <i>Luhlenses</i> in the North, the last by the <i>Tornenses</i> and <i>Kimenses</i>
in the East. And the variety of these Dialects was doubtless caused
by the difference of times in which they came into <i>Lapland</i>; some coming
sooner, some later, some settling in one part, some in another. Now of all
these Dialect, there is none more rough or unplesant then that of the
<i>Luhlenses</i>, who as well in their life and manners, as in their way of speaking,
are far the most rustick and clownish of all the <i>Laplanders</i>. But that
you may see what a disparity there is between these Dialects, I will set
down a few example: the <i>Pithenses</i> say <i>Jubmel</i>, the <i>Tornenses</i>, <i>Immel</i>, the
<i>Pithenses</i> say <i>Jocki</i>, <i>Warra</i>, <i>Olbmo</i>, <i>nisw</i>, <i>skaigki</i>, <i>kiist</i>, <i>nissu</i>, <i>pardei</i>, <i>seibig</i>,
<i>muriet</i>, <i>reppi</i>; for which the <i>Tornenses</i> put, <i>virte</i>, <i>taodar</i>, <i>almai</i>, <i>kab</i>, <i>kawtza</i>,
<i>raopka</i>, <i>kaap</i>, <i>alik</i>, <i>owre</i>, <i>kops</i>, <i>riemnes</i>. Now as the Language of the <i>Laplanders</i>
is varied according to the diversity of the Territories and Marches,
just as it is in other Nations, particularly in <i>Germany</i>, where the <i>Swavelanders</i>,
<i>Saxons</i>, and <i>Belgians</i>, speak all different tongues, so hath it this
also common with other Countries, <i>viz.</i> that the nigher the Territory tends
to any other People, so much the more do the Inhabitants participate of
their Language; and so the <i>Tornenses</i> and <i>Kimenses</i>, who border upon the
<i>Finlanders</i>, do at this day use very much of their speech: nay they go yet
farther, and make it their business to learn the Language of their Neighbours,
so the <i>Tornenses</i> and <i>Kimenses</i> get the <i>Finnonik</i>, the <i>Luhlenses</i>, <i>Pithenses</i>,
and especially the <i>Umenses</i> the Swedish Language, and that man
that is skilled in these Tongues hath not little conceit of himself, and is
indeed much esteemed among his neighbours. It is therefore no wonder if
there be many Swedish words, found among the <i>Laplanders</i>: for it could
not otherwise happen but that this People, who were supplied by others
in many things which they had not themselves, should with Forreign commodities
receive also and use Forreign names; and of this I could give many
instances, but it is not the business in hand. Now of this kind we ought
to esteem these words following; in <i>Lapland</i>, <i>Salug</i> signifies <i>blessed</i>, which
the <i>Swedes</i> call <i>Saligh</i>: <i>Niip</i> a knife, the <i>Swedes</i> call it <i>kniif</i>; <i>Fiælo</i>, a rafter
with the <i>Swedes</i> <i>tilio</i>, and many more of the like nature. Of all which the
R. and learned <i>Johan. Tornæus</i> gives this account, that the use of Forreign
words was introduced partly by necessity, and partly by conversing with
Strangers; and upon this account it is that they that converse with the <i>Swedes</i>
do oftentimes use Swedish words. The like may be said of those that deal
with the <i>Finlanders</i>, and with the <i>Germans</i> in <i>Norway</i>, and this is the reason
why one and the same thing is often called by divers appellations, as for
example, the <i>Swedes</i> call a Horse <i>Hæst</i>, the <i>Finlanders</i>, <i>Hapoitz</i>, the <i>Germans</i>,
<i>Ross</i>, which also is the name the <i>Laplanders</i> give the beast, for they
having no Horses of their own were forced to borrow a name from the
Country from whence they had them. Now what <i>Tornæus</i> observes concerning
the word <i>Ross</i>, I beleive may be applyed also to the word <i>Porcus</i>, which
I suppose they had rather from the <i>Germans</i> then <i>Latines</i>, for the <i>Germans</i>
call a Barrow-Hog, <i>Bork</i>, now their Swine they had all out of <i>Norway</i>, and
it is very probable they did thence borrow that appellation also. And not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to trouble our selves any farther, this will hold true in all the rest of that
kind. Wherefore setting apart other considerations, and looking upon this
Language, not as it contains in it forreign words, but only such as they
alwaies used within themselves, and were ever received among them, it
remains that we conclude it to be not a miscellany or collection of Latin,
German, Swedish scraps, and the like, neither as a peculiar speech, different
from them altogether, but such as originally took its rise from the <i>Finlanders</i>,
tho time hath brought it to pass that perhaps few of them understand it.</p>

<p>This Tongue, as well as others, hath its Declensions, Comparisons,
Conjugations, Moods, Tenses, <i>&amp;c.</i> and perhaps it may not be amiss if I
should here insert some examples: I will therefore first decline you a Laplandish
Noun, and afterwards give you the Finnonick Declension of the
same, that by comparing both you may better understand the parity and
disparity of these Languages. This Noun shall be <i>Immel</i>, for so the <i>Tornenses</i>
call it, tho other say <i>Jubmel</i>, the <i>Finlanders</i> terms it <i>Jumala</i>, and
it signifies <i>God</i>.</p>

<p>These will serve to give us some light into the nature of this Language,
at least as much as is to our purpose, who did not undertake to write a
Grammar, but only give some small description.</p>

<p>Now the <i>Laplanders</i> have a peculiar way of pronouncing words, according
to which it is impossible to express them in letters, for they do mouth out
all their words, so that the vowels might be heard loud enough, but the
other letters come very softly out; they do also quite cut off and drown the last
syllables, especially of Nouns. Letters they neither have, nor ever had any,
and in this they agree with their ancestors the <i>Finlander</i>: the Calendar which
they use, is no other but the Swedish in <i>Runick</i> letters. And this also, before
they came to have commerce with the <i>Swedes</i>, and had learned of them the
observation of Holy-daies, was never in use among them. <i>Johannes Buræus</i>
tells us that he heard from persons of good credit, of certain grave-stones
and monuments, which had sometimes bin found in <i>Lapland</i> (more whereof
perhaps might be found) on which were engraved <i>Runick</i> Characters.
But suppose we this true, it is not, I hope, therefore necessary that we
should conclude that these were formerly the letters of the <i>Laplanders</i>, to
which indeed, as well themselves as their forefathers the <i>Finlanders</i> are equally
Strangers. But we have more reason to think that the <i>Swedes</i> coming
thither in ancient times, either by force of arms, or otherwise, inhabited
there abouts, and left those stones. To this day both the <i>Laplander</i> and <i>Finlander</i>
use the Latine letters; in the same Character the <i>Swedes</i> and <i>Germans</i>
make them, altho the number of them that can read among them is but very
small, and of them that can write, a great deal less, and are only such as
they call great Scholars.</p>

<p>Now this Speech being only used among the <i>Laplanders</i>, and there
being none that desire to learn it but themselves, in all negotiations with
others, they are forced to use the help of Interpreters, of whom upon this
account there are great numbers, as I have formerly said: tho these Interpreters
speak all Languages, but the <i>Finnonick</i>, very barbarously, which
is also the fault of all <i>Laplanders</i>, who are very hardly brought to learn or
pronounce any other Tongue, and much given to confound one with another.
So that they which traffic in <i>Norway</i>, and border upon that Country,
do in their speaking mingle together the Speech of the <i>Norwegians</i> and <i>Swedes</i>,
as for instance, <i>jeghkiæmi</i>, for <i>jag kom</i>, <i>jag gaong</i>, for <i>jag goar</i>. So for
<i>hustro</i>, they say <i>koona</i>, for <i>min myssa</i>, <i>mitt hofwud</i>, &amp;c. But of the Language
of the <i>Laplanders</i> let this suffice.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Houses of the</i> Laplanders.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Hitherto we have treated of the <i>Laplander</i> as he hath relation
to the Common-wealth, we shall in the next place speak of him as
a private person. And this we shall do first, considering the things they
have need of. Secondly, their imployments. And thirdly their leasure and
pastimes. All necessary accommodations are either such as are to defend us
from ill inconveniences, or to give us necessaries. Of the first sort, are
Houses and Cloathes, of the 2<sup>d</sup>, Meat and Drink. We shall begin with
their houses, or places of aboad. The <i>Laplanders</i> have not any houses like
other Northern People, it having bin their custom to wander up and down,
and so, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another, to set up small
sheds for their present use: so that they had no certain habitations, but
having eaten and consumed the fish and beasts in one place, they march
to another, carrying their sheds or tents with them.</p>

<p>But this liberty of wandring up and down the Country, was in a special
Edict forbid them by <i>Charles</i> the ninth, in the year 1602, and a certain
place of habitation assigned to every family. The words of the Edict are
to this purpose: “We do in the first place command that in every <i>Lapmark</i>
an account be taken of all Fenns, Rivers, Lakes, <i>&amp;c.</i> and who
they are that have hitherto had the benefit and use of them, with the names
of all such: and then that the number of the families be compared with
that of the Rivers, <i>&amp;c.</i> and so equally divided that one family shall not
possess more Rivers and Fenns then are for its use. Lastly every <i>Lapmark</i>
being thus divided, it shall be committed to honest and good men,
who, without either favor or prejudice, shall assign to every family its
just portion: and thenceforth it shall not be lawfull for any <i>Laplander</i>,
at his plesure to wander up and down all marches, as hath formerly bin
used.” From the time of this Edict the <i>Laplanders</i> had their certain bounds
and limits assigned them sufficient for the sustaining of their families. Neither
was it afterward lawfull for any one to invade the propriety of another,
or to wander where he pleased.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, that custom of removing their sheds from one place to
another was quite abolished, but is yet used among them, tho now they
move not out of the bounds assigned them. So that they have no certain mansion,
but as the Season of the year offers it self, either for fishing or hunting,
so do they order their habitations accordingly on the side of some River,
Wood, or Mountain, and having spent there some daies or weeks, remove
their tents again to a more seasonable place. To this agrees also our modern
writer <i>Sam. Rheen</i>. This wandring is chiefly caused by their manner of
getting their living, for the <i>Laplanders</i> having all their livelihood from
Rain-deers, Fish, and wild beasts, they are forced to live where they may
have sufficient pastures for their Rain-deers, and plenty of other beasts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and fishes for themselves; and yet to take care that they destroy not the
breed. But this cannot be done if they should live alwaies in one place,
and therefore it is that <i>Buræus</i> saies, they order their habitations according
to the seasons of fishing, hunting, <i>&amp;c.</i> Now this conveniency cannot be in
all places at all times alike, for fish do abound most when about the time of
their spawning they are gathered together, which some fish do at one time,
and some at another, and one sort in one Lake, and another sort in another
Lake; so that they that are of this trade cannot alwaies live in one place.
In like manner it is also with their Rain-deers: and therefore <i>Sam. Rheen</i>
saies they take their journeys either to provide pasture for their Rain-deers,
or to fish: for at that time, when fishes generate either in this or
that Lake or River, then the <i>Laplander</i>, with his house and family, takes
his journy. But this journeying is not so as that they should forsake and
never return again to their former places; but they do, as it were, go
in a circle: so that in the space of a year, the pasture being again grown
that was before consumed, they return into the same seats again. This is
the custom of the <i>Laplanders</i> that live in the Mountains: but they that live
in the Woods, do not only once a year, but oftner return into the same
places. For they leave and return to their habitations severall times in a
year, <i>viz.</i> as often as occasion is offerred either of fishing, fowling, hunting,
<i>&amp;c.</i> Now they do so order their journeys, that the Fishermen at those
times when the fishes do spawn, do alwaies live on the side of some River.
They that take care of, and trade with Rain-deers, do in the Winter live
in the Woods, but in the Summer ascend towards the mountains of <i>Norway</i>:
for in the Winter they cannot abide on those Mountains, where there
are so frequent storms, great Snows, and no Wood. At that season therefore
they descend into the nighest woods, where by reason of the depth
of the Snow they can easily keep their Rain-deers together: so that from
Christmas untill the Feast of the Annunciation they remain for the most
part in one place, at which time the Snow beginning to melt, they march
nigher and nigher again towards the Mountains, where they remain till S.
<i>Ericus</i>’s day: about which time because the female Rain-deer use to bring
forth, therefore they remain in the same place untill the feast of <i>S. John</i>,
or Midsummer-day. Afterwards, when, as well in the Mountains as Vallies,
the grass and pasture do most florish, they proceed farther and farther, some
on the tops of the highest Mountains, where the Rain-deers are less infested
with flies and gnats, in which Mountains they wander up and down
till the feast of S. <i>Bartholomew</i>, when by little and little they betake themselves
to the Woods again, and then <i>Christmas</i> coming they do again as we
told you in the beginning. And these are the circuits of the <i>Laplanders</i>, and
reasons why they cannot stay in one place, together with the times of their
severall removes. But now these journeys sometimes are for many miles,
and of a far longer space of time, so that sometimes they march for 20
miles and farther. Now because some of them live in the Mountains, some
among the Trees, especially Pine-trees, nigh the Rivers and Lakes; therefore
are they accordingly called by different names. Some are called <i>fiæll
Lapper</i>, because they live in the Mountains nigh <i>Norway</i>, which are called
<i>fiæll</i>. Others are termed <i>Graan Lapper</i>, because they live among the Pine
trees, which are called by the <i>Swedes</i> and <i>Norwegians</i>, <i>Graan</i>. For their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
journeys in the Summer they make different preparations from what they
do in the Winter; in the Winter they use sledges (of which I will speak
hereafter) but in the Summer they go on foot, the Rain-deers carrying their
goods on pannels and pack-saddles, and sometimes their Infants also. So
that in the Winter they put their houshold-stuff in one sledge, and their
tents in another, and so march from place to place, but in the Summer
they use pannels which they make after this manner:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/zill_t082.jpg" width="600" height="786" alt="reindeer and pannier bags" />
</a>
</div>

<p class="noindent">They have two lathes something broad, but flexible, made of firr, of which
for the most part Boxes are made, these lathes they joyn together at the top,
putting the one end into a mortice made in the other end, and so make a
kind of a circle, then by that part where they are joyned together they
hang them on the Rain-deer, one on the right-side, the other on the left,
and so againe by withes ty them under the beasts belly, that they may be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
more steady. Now these are placed so to support their dorsers made of the
same wood, bended into an oval figure much like a drum, if both ends were
round. These dorsers at the bottom they draw together with twiggs of birch,
placed in the form of a grate, and the tops of them they tye with thongs,
or cords, which they loose as often as any thing is to be put in, or taken
out; and least any thing should fall out, they cover these dorsers all over
with bark of birch, or some skins. These dorsers they hang by ropes or
thongs to the tops of the forementioned lathes, which they call <i>Tobbii</i>;
so that they may hang down on both sides the Rain-deer, the tops being
outward, and the bottoms turned inward toward the belly of the beast.
And thus they load their Rain-deers, not only with their goods and houshold
stuff, but also with their Infants, which cannot walk themselves. For
on one side of the Rain-deer they often hang their cradles, and children in
them, of which I will speak hereafter. Now in these journeys they have a
certain order which no one without cause ought to disturb; for in the first
place marches the Master of the Family, having some Rain-deers after him,
loaded after the foresaid manner, afterwards follows his wife in like manner;
then the whole herd of Rain-deers, which his Children and Servants
drive softly on. Last of all brings up the rear, he that carries the Drum.
Now these pack-Rain-deers they do not use to drive yoked or joyned together,
but in a long line one after another, that which follows being alwaies
tied to the pannels of that which went before, and the <i>Laplander</i>
leading the foremost by a rope tied about his neck, and so they march on
till they come to the place intended, where they set up their sheds again,
and remain for some weeks, which are to them instead of houses. But now
there is some difference in the sheds of the <i>Laplanders</i> that live in the
mountains, and are called <i>Fiællapper</i>, and those that live in the Woods,
who are called <i>Graan Lapper</i>; for the one coming to the same place but once
in a year, doth not build this shed of so durable stuff as the other: the former,
when he departs, almost destroying his habitation, and the latter leaving it
standing. The former build their sheds thus, first, at four corners they erect
four posts, upon the tops of which they place three rafters, so that there
shall be one on each side, and one behind, but none cross the formost posts;
upon these rafters they afterwards place long poles, so that with their tops
they may lean upon, and support one another, whereby the whole form
seems to be like a quadrilaterall house, which ascending like a Pyramide,
is narrower at top, and broader at bottom. These poles so placed they cover
with course woollen cloth, which we before called <i>Waldmar</i>; but the richer
sort over this woollen cloth place linnen also, by both which they may be
the better defended from rain and storms. These are the sheds of the <i>Laplanders</i>
that dwell in the mountains, for the most part made of clothes, &amp;c.
which when they leave any place they take with them, and erect in another.
But your <i>Graanlapper</i>, or <i>Wood-Laplanders</i>, make their sheds for the most
part of board and posts, that at the top meet in a Cone, which they cover
with the boughs of Firr and Pine-trees, or else with the bark of those trees,
and sometimes with turff. That they covered them with the barks of trees,
<i>Herberstenius</i> witnesseth; <i>Andræas Buræus</i> saies that those barks were of birch
trees, to whom also assents <i>Olaus Petri</i>, who only adds, that they did a long
time boil those barks to make them more flexible. <i>Olaus Magnus</i>, Lib. 4.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Cap. 3. adds also skins, and these were the houses <i>Lomenius Comes</i> saw, and
describes in his Itinerary to be made of long poles and barks of trees. <i>Sam.
Rheen</i> describes the tents of the <i>Wood-Laplanders</i> to be made of boards with
six sides or walls, covered with boughs of Firr, or Pine-trees, sometimes
with the barks, and sometimes only with turffs. <i>Wexionius</i> increases the
number of sides, and saies that they were octogons, somewhat broader towards
the bottom, and five ells high, and especially those tents of the <i>Kimenses</i>.
<i>Olaus Petri</i> tells us the same of the <i>Pithenses</i>. Now these Tents
they do not pull down or carry with them, but leave them in the same place,
only when they come again they add new boughs, &amp;c. where they were
decayed, and to fit them for their use. Besides these two sorts of Tents,
<i>Olaus Magnus</i> reckons up another, for in this, Lib. 4. Cap. 2. he saies part
of them place their Tents in trees that grow in a square figure, least in the
fenny Countries they should be choaked with the great snows, or devoured
by the wild beasts, which come together in great troops. What he means
by trees that grow in a square figure I cannot tell, but I suppose he intends
only that they did use to erect their Tents between 4 trees which grew so,
that each of them might be the corner prop, of the four square shed, but
this sort is to us quite unknow. <i>Tacitus</i> saies the <i>Fenni</i> used to dwell among
a company of boughs, and perhaps that gave occasion to our Author to talk
thus. He hath also got a 4<sup>th</sup> sort which he could have no where else but
from <i>Zieglerus</i>, for <i>Zieglerus</i> had called them <i>Amaxobios</i>, from whence
<i>Olaus Magnus</i> saies they dwelt in Waines and Carts; and therefore <i>Olaus</i> induced
by this word of <i>Zieglerus</i>, thought the <i>Laplanders</i> had bin such. But
this is quite false, for Waggons and Carts were utterly unknown to the
<i>Laplanders</i>, for whom it was impossible to use them, by reason of the slipperiness
of the Ice, and depth of their snows. Neither was it indeed in that
sense that <i>Zieglerus</i> calls them <i>Amaxiobios</i>, but because they wandred up
and down like the <i>Amaxobii</i>, who are a known Nation of the <i>Scythians</i>.
There remains therefore only these two sorts of sheds, which I have mentioned,
for the 5<sup>th</sup>, which <i>Paulus Jovius</i> reckons, was either upon sudden
occasions, or used only by those that were under the dominion of the <i>Moscovites</i>:
the words of this Author are, “These People lie in caves filled
with dried leaves, or in trunks of trees made hollow either by fire or age.”
But in both our forementioned sorts, things are so ordered that every Tent
had two doors, one, a foredoor, and the other, a backward; the former
bigger and more ordinarily used, the latter less, through which they use to
bring in their provisions, and especially the prey they took in hunting, also
Birds, Beasts, Fishes, which it was unlawfull for to bring in at the foredoor.
These are the two doors with the use of both, especially the back-door,
through which it was unlawfull for any woman to pass, because, as I said
before, women were forbidden to go into the back part of the Tent, the
reason of which I think to be partly this, because in that part they placed
<i>Thor</i> and sacrificed to him, and partly this, because it was esteemed an ill
omen for a hunter to meet a woman. And hither may we refer what <i>Zieglerus</i>
saies of that door, that it was unlawfull for the Woman to go out
of the door of the Tent that day her husband was gone a hunting, which
cannot be understood of any door but the back-door, the use of which was
not only that day but alwaies forbid women. The <i>Laplanders</i> have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Chambers, but only certain spaces, which they determine and bound by loggs
and posts laid along on the ground, of which we shall next speak. The whole
space of ground within the Tent was so ordered, that in the middle there
might be a hearth, surrounded with stones, in which there was a continual
fire, except at midnight; behind the hearth, toward the back part of the tent,
they place three loggs, with which they bound that space, of which we but
now spoke. In the middle of this space is the little door, at which only men
must enter, which they call <i>Posse</i>; right over against that is the common door,
which they call <i>Ox</i>; but that space we told you was bounded with these
three loggs, they call, <i>lops</i>; this place therefore is only proper to men,
and it is unlawfull for any woman to pass those loggs, and go into it. <i>Sam.
Rheen</i> saies about the kettle hanging over the fire, they place the 3 blocks,
upon which, with a hatchet, they divide their flesh, fish, or other things
they intend to make ready. He saies here indeed the space is called <i>Posse</i>, but
understands chiefly the space of the door, for that was properly called <i>Posse</i>;
the other space being called <i>Lops</i>. The common door they used to make towards
the South, and the other towards the North. The space on both
sides, and the sides themselves they called <i>Loide</i>; here they made their bed
chambers, the husband with his wife and children lying on one side, and
the servants on the other. <i>Olaus Petri</i> saies only the daughters lay on the
side of the husband and wife, I believe, that their Parents might have them
alwaies nigh them, and so take greater care to secure their honesty, whilst
the sons in the mean time lay with the servants: but now the spaces that
remain towards the doors they call <i>Kitta</i>, and are ordained for the use
of the women, for in the space nigh the common door they are brought
to bed. But that you may the better understand all this, I will here insert
a description of the Area.
A is the little door they call
<i>posse</i>, B and C is called <i>lopps</i>,
as is the place where the
men lay up their hunting
instruments. D and E are
called <i>loide</i>, whereof one is
the appartment of the Master
of the Family and his
wife, the other of the servants.
F. G. is <i>kitta</i>, were
the women are conversant.
H. is the hearth, I. the door
called <i>ox</i>; those three logs
upon which they divide
their flesh are the two that
lay along towards I. and the
3<sup>d</sup> crosswaies distinguishes
from other parts the mens
appartment, or <i>posse</i>.</p>

<p>The 3<sup>d</sup> thing we are to note in these sheds, is that they strew their floors
with branches of Birch trees, least by the rain they should be wetted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
they use no other kind of pavement; only upon the boughs, for cleanliness
sake, they lay skins of Rain-deers, on which they sit and lie. And these are
the dwelling houses of the <i>Laplanders</i>, besides which they have also Store-houses
in which they keep their commodities, especially flesh, fish, and such
other provisions; these they call <i>Nalla</i>, and make thus: they cut the upper
part of a tree off, so that the body remain four or five ells from the ground
high, upon this trunk they place two rafters in the figure of an X, or S<sup>t</sup>
<i>Andrews</i> Cross, and upon these they build their repository, making a door
to it, and covering it with boards. There is one thing peculiar to these Store-houses,
which is, that the door is not in the side, but bottom of them, so that
when the <i>Laplander</i> is come down, the door falls too, like a trap-door, and
all things are safe. To these they go up by ladders which they make of the
trunks of trees, in which they cut great notches like stairs. Now the reason
why they place them so high, is because of the Bears and other wild beasts,
who oftentimes pull them down, and to the great dammage of the Master
eat all his provision; they used also to cut off the bark of the tree, and
anoint the stock, so that neither mice nor wild beasts could be able to climb
up for slipperiness. And perhaps these are the houses <i>Olaus magnus</i> meant,
when he said, they placed their houses upon trees for fear of wild beasts. But
that you may the better conceive these Store-houses also, I shall here give
you the Figure of them.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Garments of the</i> Laplanders.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Among the <i>Laplanders</i> the men and women wear different kinds of
Garments, which they alter according to the Weather, and place: for
they wear one sort of clothes in the Winter, and another sort in the Summer,
one kind at home, and another abroad. Let us first consider the Garments
of the men: These in the Summer have trouses, or brougs, reaching
down to their feet, close to their body, upon which they wear a gown, or
rather a coat with sleeves, which comes down to the middle leg, which they
tie fast with a girdle. And in this respect it was that <i>Zieglerus</i> in his time
wrote, that they used close Garments fitted to their body, least they should
hinder their work. He calls them close because of their trouses, and fitted
to their body because of their being girded. These they wear next their
bare skin, without such linnen shirts as the <i>Europeans</i> use, they having no
flax in their Country. These Garments are of course home-spun woollen
cloth called <i>Waldmar</i>, of a white or gray color, such as the wool is of before
it is dyed. The wool they have from <i>Swedland</i>, and buy it of the
Merchants called <i>Birkarli</i>, but the richer sort wear a finer cloth, and not
of the same color, but sometimes green or blew, and sometimes red, only
black they abominate. Tho sometimes in dirty works, and at home they
wear the meanest clothes, yet abroad, and especially upon Festivals and
Holydaies, they love to go very neat. Their girdles are made of leather,
which the richer sort adorn with silver studs, and poorer with tin. These
studs stick out like buttons in a semicircular figure. At this girdle they
hang a knife and sheath, and a kind of square bag, tho something longer
then broad, also a leathern purse, and then a case with needles and thred
in it. Their knives they have from <i>Norway</i>, the sheath is of the skin of
the Rain-deers, sewed together with tin wire, and in other parts with
the same adornments, at the end of which they use to hang rings: the bag
is also made of the skin of the Raindeers, with the hair on it, on the outside
of which they also place another skin, equall to the bag, and make it
fast by three knots, and this skin they cover again with red cloth or of
some other color, adorned also with wire. In this bag they keep a stone to
strike fire, not of flint, but christall, as I will shew hereafter. Also a
steel, with some brimestone to light a fire where ever they come: as also
Tobacco and other odd things. The leathern purse is also made of the same
skin in an oval figure like a pear, in which they keep their mony, and
other more choice things, and at this also they hang rings. Their needle case
is of a peculiar sort, they have a single cloth with four sides, but the upper
part is much narrower then the lower, so that it is like an oblong triangle
cut off at the vertical angle, and to make it stronger they bind about the
edges with leather, and so stick their needles into it, this they put into a
bag of the same shape, adorned with red, or some other colored cloth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
wire, drawn together by a leathern string, by which they hang it to their
girdle. Besides these, they have Alchymy chains, with a great company of
rings of the same, these they hang about all their body, the bag they hang
before, nigh their navel, all the rest they fling behind them. And these
are the Garments and ornaments of the body: their head they cover with
a cap, over which the richer sort wear a case of Fox, Beaver, or Badgers
skin, they are very like our night-caps, it is made of red or other colored
cloth, or of the Hares fur, first twisted into a thred, and then knit almost
like our stockins; or lastly of the skin of the bird called <i>Loom</i>, with the
feathers on it: sometimes they so order it, that keeping also the head and
wings of the bird, they make not an unbecoming cover for the head. <i>Olaus
Magnus</i> in his 4. Book, Cap. 3. saies they make their caps of the skins of
Geese, Ducks, Cocks, which, as well as other birds, are there in great
abundance. But he doth not here mean common Cocks, but the <i>Urogalli</i>,
or Heath-Cocks; however he gives us the picture in his 17 Book, Cap.
26. They have ordinary gloves, but shoes of a peculiar make, they are made
of the skin of the Rain-deer with the hair on, out of one piece, only where
they tread they sew both ends together, so that the haires of one part
may lie forward, and the other backward, least if they lay all one way they
should be too slippery: but neither is there any more leather on the bottom
then on other parts, as it is in our shoes, only there is a hole at the top
in which they put in their feet: the toe bends upwards, and ends as it were
in a point. Upon the seame they place some narrow pieces of red, or other
colored cloth: these shoes they wear on their bare feet, and bind them
twice or thrice about the bottom with a thong, and least they should be too
loose, they fill them up with a sort of long Hay, which they boil and keep
for that purpose.</p>

<p>But now let us come to the garments they do not so ordinarily wear,
but only on some occasions, which both for the men and women are made
alike, and all of leather, to secure them from the gnats. But in the Winter
time the men have breeches to defend them from the weather, and coats
which they call <i>Mudd</i>. These <i>Mudd</i> are not all alike, but some better, some
worse; the best are of the skins of young wild Rain-deers, just when they
have cast their first coat, in the place of which comes a black one, which
is about the Feast of S<sup>t</sup> <i>James</i>, and these are very soft and delicate. Their
feet they defend with boots of the same skins, and their hands with gloves
or mittens of the same, and their heads with a cap, which reaches down
and covers part of their shoulders also, leaving only a space for them to
see through. All these Garments they wear next their skin without any linnen
underneath, and tie them round with a girdle, only their boots and
gloves they stuff with hay, and sometimes in the Winter with wool. And
this is that which <i>Johannes Tornæus</i> saies of their cloathing, that their garment
is made of the Rain-deer, the skin of the beast supplying them with
coats, breeches, gloves, sandals, shoes, &amp;c. the hair being alwaies on the
outside, so that they seem to be all hairy. And hence we may understand
<i>Zieglerus</i>, when he saies their Winter garments were made of the skins of
Bears and Sea-Calves, which they tied in a knot at the top of their heads,
leaving nothing to be seen but their eyes, so that they seemed to be in a sack,
only that it was made according to the shape of their members; and hence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
saies he, I beleive they came to be supposed all hairy like beasts, some
reporting this out of ignorance, and some delighting to tell of strange
wonders they saw abroad. And truly it is not without reason that he gathers
the fable of hairy men to be raised from their hairy Garments, which sort
of monsters whether there be in other Countries I cannot tell, but I find
the <i>Cyclops</i>’s with one eye in their forehead by <i>Adamus Bremensis</i> to be placed
here upon the same account, because they had only a hole in their cap
through which they looked, all the rest of their body seeming hairy, and
therefore this hole they feigned to be an eye. But whereas he saies the skins
were of Bears and Sea-Calves, he is a little mistaken, for these skins were
not so common among the <i>Laplanders</i>, and are by them designed quite for
another use. However these Garments they used after their fashion to adorn
with pieces of red, or other colored cloth, and embroider them with wire,
in flowers, stars, &amp;c. as I will hereafter declare more at large.</p>

<p>But I come to the habit of the women, which also was of one sort in the
Summer, and of another in the Winter. In the Summer they wear coats
which cover their breasts, arms, and all their body, about the middle they
are gathered, and so hang down, these they call <i>Volpi</i>. These gowns they
also wear next their skin, for the use of smocks is no more known among
women then the use of shirts among men: and they horribly imposed upon
<i>Lomenius Comes</i>, that made him beleive otherwise. <i>Lomenius</i> saies thus, they
have smocks, not made of linnen, but of the entrails of beasts, which they
first spin into thread, and afterwards wear them: but all this is quite false.
The entrals indeed they do spin into thred, but of that they make neither
cloth nor smocks, but use it to sew their skins; but women of the common
sort wear course cloth, and the better sort finer, as it is with the men,
which for the most part is English cloth, richly wrought. They have also
a girdle, but different from that of the men, for it is much larger, and
sometimes three fingers broad, and then also it is adorned not with studs,
but plates of a fingers length, or more, which are engraved with divers
shapes of Birds, Flowers, &amp;c. and these they fasten upon a leathern fillet
so nigh one another, that the girdle is almost covered with them. These
plates are most commonly made of tin, from whence <i>Sam. Rheen</i> calls them
tin girdles, but those for the better sort are made of silver. Upon these
girdles they hang many Alchymy chains, upon one of which they hang a
knife and sheath, upon another a pouch or purse, upon another a needle
case, and upon all a great company of Alchymy rings, according to the
fashion of the men: These things they do not hang by their sides, as women
among us use, but before them. The weight of the trinkets they carry about
them, doth commonly weigh twenty pound, a pretty heavy burden, and
such as a man would wonder they should be able to bear: but they are very
much delighted with it, especially with the number of the rings, the gingling
of which is very gratefull to their ear, and as they think no small commendation
to their beauty. <i>Wexionius</i> makes the chains and rings to be tin,
which I beleive is hardly true, commonly I am sure they were made of Alchymy,
and if they had bin of tin they had neither bin durable, nor would
they have made a noise. They have also another ornament for their breast,
which they call <i>Kracha</i>, it is made of red, or some other colored cloth.
And first it goes about their neck, and then on both sides comes down upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
their breast, and a little below their breast ends in a narrow point. This
cloth, especially before, and sometimes about the neck, they adorn with
studs, engraved with divers forms, as also with bracelets, which the richer
have of silver and gold, the poorer of tin and Alchymy. After this manner,
in short as he uses, <i>Johannes Tornæus</i> describes them, the women do so deck
themselves with gold and silver that their breasts shine like sheilds, but those
that cannot reach silver, use copper and Alchymy. Now these studs they use
to have not only about their neck, but upon their gowns where they draw
them together, and lace them; and not only in single but double and triple
rows. They cover their heads with a low kind of kercheif, plain at top,
round, and of red color, some of the richer sort on extraordinary times
add also a strip of linnen for ornament, as at their Fairs, Weddings, and
Feasts. Upon their legs they wear stockins, which reach no lower then
their ankles, but that only in the Summer. Their shoes are like the mens,
and so also bound to their feet with thongs. The womens habit in the Winter
is almost the same with the mens, for they have the <i>Muddas</i> made of the
skins of Rain-deers, and at that time wear breeches too, by reason of the
deep Snows, storms, and badness of the waies: nay and cover their head
with the same caps men do, which sort of caps they wear also sometimes
in the Summer to defend them from the gnats: these caps they tie about
their heads, and the lower part, which would otherwise fall about their
shoulders, they make to stand out like the brims of our hats. And these
are the garments as well of Virgins as married women, for both use the
same attire, neither is there any sign in their habit whereby to distinguish
them. Besides these garments wherewith they clothe themselves in the day,
they have also other which they use a nights, such as are called night-cloathes,
for they have no feather beds: and without all doubt <i>Olaus Magnus</i> is mistaken
who in his 4 Book saies they had. Their night garments were of 2
sorts, such as they lay upon, or such as they did cover themselves with,
which also differ according to the Summer and Winter Seasons. Those they
lie upon are Rain-deers skins, 2 or 3 of which they fling upon some birch
leaves, which they use instead of matts, without beds, upon the ground,
that they may lie softer, so that they lie upon the skins without sheets, of
the use of which they are quite ignorant. They cover themselves in the
Summer with blankets, which they call <i>raaner</i> or <i>ryer</i>, and with these blankets
they cover not only their whole body, but also their heads too, to
avoid the gnats, with which they are extremly infested in the night time.
But that they may breath with more freedom, and not be inconvenienced
with the weight of these blankets, they sometimes hang them up
over their head with ropes fastned to the top of their Hut. These are their
Summer coverlets: but in the Winter they first throw about them the skins
of Sheep or Rain-deer, and on them the blankets now mentioned. And there
is one thing more worth our notice, that they lie under these both Winter
and Summer stark naked, and make no use of linnen. And so much for the
Garments of the <i>Laplanders</i>. I shall add the Figures of both Sexes habited
after their manner. The woman hath a child in her arms, in a Laplandish
Cradle.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Diet of the</i> Laplanders.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Having discoursed of their Garments, I proceed to speak of their
Diet. Their food is not the same amongst them all, but different
according to the places they inhabit. The Mountaineers live almost wholly
on their Rain-deers, that furnish them with Milk, Cheese, and Flesh: tho
sometimes they buy from the neighboring parts of <i>Norway</i> Sheep, Goats,
and Oxen, which they milk in the Summer, and kill in the Winter, because
they have neither Pasture nor Stable room for them to keep them
long. And for this reason they buy but very few of them, and feed almost al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>together
on their Rain-deer, which they have in great abundance. The
flesh of these they feed on in the Winter, and that alwaies boiled, but
in the Summer their diet is Milk, Cheese, and dried flesh. Their dainties
most in esteem with them are the tongue and marrow of their Rain-deers,
and with these they are want to entertain their Priests. One odd kind of dish
these of the Mountains have, and that is the blood of their Rain-deers boiled
in water to the consistence of a hasty pudding. The others that dwell in
the Woods feed partly on Fish, and partly on Birds and Beasts, and that
too both Summer and Winter, but more frequently on Fish. The flesh of
Beares they prefer before all other, and with that they feast their dearest
friends.</p>

<p>They have also some kind of Sawces of Black-berries, Straw-berries,
and other peculiar ones of their own, as also wild <i>Angelica</i>, and the inner
rine of the Pine-tree. The use of Bread and Salt is almost unknown to
them, and when they have any of the later, they use it very sparingly. Instead
of bread they eat dried fish, which by grinding they reduce to a kind
of meal, and instead of Salt the inward rine of the Pine-tree, prepared
after an odd kind of manner. They pull the bark off first, and then they
take the inward rine, and divide it into thin skins like parchment, making
it very clean; these they dry in the Sun, and then tearing it into small pieces
they put it up in boxes made of the barks of trees: these they bury under
ground, and cover them with sand. When they have bin dried about a day,
they kindle a great fire over the hole where they put their boxes, and by
that means the rines acquire a red color, and a very pleasant tast. On Fridaies
they eat no flesh, but feed either on fish, or milk, having retained
this custom from their Roman Catholic Priests. They boil all their fresh
flesh, but not very much; that their broth may be the better and fuller of
gravy: and sometimes they put also fish into the same kettle. Their milk
they either boil with some quantity of water, it being of it self to thick,
or else they let it stand in the cold, to freeze into a kind of Cheese, that
it may be kept longer for use. Their fish they eat sometimes fresh as soon as
they catch them; sometimes they dry them in the Sun, and being hardned
by the wind and air, they may be kept severall years.</p>

<p>Their sweet meats, which serve them instead of Apples, Nuts, and the
like, are preparations made of severall sorts of Berries. When their Straw-berries
begin to be ripe, they gather them, and boil them in their own
juice, without the addition of water, with a slow fire, till they are very
soft: then they sprinkle them over with a little salt, and putting them into
a vessell made of birch-bark, they bury it in the ground: and in the Autumn
and Winter when they have occasion for them, they take them out
as fresh as if they had bin newly gathered: and these stand them in good stead
when no other Berries are to be had. Sometimes whilst they are fresh they
put them to the flesh of Fish, and make an odd kind of dish, after this
manner. Having boiled the Fish they first bone them, and then add Straw-berries
to them, and beat them together in a wooden pestle to a mash, and
so eat it with spoons. And this dish they make also with all other kinds of
Berries. Another Kickshaw that pleaseth them very much, they make of
<i>Angelica</i>. They take the staulks before it seed, and scraping of the outward
skin, they put the rest upon coals, and so eat it broiled. They have also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
another way of preparing it, and that is to boil them in whay for a whole
day till they look as red as blood. But this sort of meat is very bitter of
it self, but by custom becomes plesant enough to them, especially since
they are perswaded ’tis a great preservative of health. They likewise boil
sorrell in milk; as also the rine of the Pine-tree, which, as was said before,
being prepared, serves them instead of salt.</p>

<p>I come next to speak of their drink, which is ordinarily nothing but
water; <i>Lomenius</i> calls it <i>dissolved Ice</i>: but certainly he is mistaken, for
having such plenty of Rivers and Lakes, for all the Ice they can hardly
want water. And to prevent its freezing, they have alwaies some hanging
over the fire in a kettle; out of which everyone with a spoon takes what
he pleases, and so drinks it hot, especially in the Winter time. Besides
common water, they often drink the broth I spoke of, made of flesh and
fish, which they call <i>Læbma</i>, and also whay, if you will beleive <i>Olaus</i>.
These are their usuall drinks; for Ale and Beer is utterly unknown to them.
That which they drink for plesure, is spirit of Wine and Brandy, with
a little of which you may win their very souls. This they buy from <i>Norway</i>
at their Fair times, and use it especially at their solemn Feasts and
Weddings. I had almost forgot <i>Tobacco</i>, of which they are very great admirers,
and traffic for it as one of their cheif commodities.</p>

<p>In the next place let us see the manner of their eating. Their dining room
in the Winter time is that part of the Hut where the man and his wife and
daughters use to be, and is on the right hand as you go in at the foregate:
but in Summer without doors upon the green grass. Sometimes too they are
want to sit about the kettle in the middle of the Hut. They use not much
ceremony about their places, but every one takes it as he comes first. They
seat themselves upon a skin spread on the ground cross-leg’d in a round
ring; and the meat is set before them in the middle, upon a log or stump
instead of a table; and severall have not that, but lay their meat upon the
skin which they sit on. Having taken the flesh out of the kettle, the common
sort put it upon a woollen table cloth called <i>Waldmar</i>, the richer on
a linnen; as for trenchers and dishes they are quite unknown to them. But
if any liquid thing be to be served up, they put it in a kind of trey made
of birch. Sometimes without any other ceremony every one takes his share
out of the kettle, and puts it upon his gloves, or his cap. Their drink they
take up in a wooden Ladle, which serves instead of plate. And it is farther
observable that they are abominable gluttons when they can get meat enough;
and yet hardy too to endure the most pinching hunger when they are forc’t
to it. When their meal is ended they first give God thanks, and then they
mutually exhort one another to Faith and Charity, taking each other by
the right hand, which is a symbol of their unity and brotherhood. <i>Samuel
Rheen</i> tells us they lift up their hands first, and then say Grace after this
manner, <i>All thanks be given to God, who hath provided this meat for our
sustenance</i>. This is their Grace in <i>Pithilapmark</i>. In <i>Tornelapmark</i> their Grace
is a little different; they say in their own Tongue, <i>Piaomaos Immel lægos
kitomatz piergao odest adde misg mosea wicken ieggan taide ko mig læx
iegnaston</i>, that is, <i>Good God praised be thou for this meat: make that which
we have at this time eaten give strength to our bodies</i>. And so much for their
Diet, and manner of eating.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Hunting of the</i> Laplanders.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Having spoke of those things that relate to their Meat, Drink,
Cloathing, and other necessities, the subject of our next discourse
will be their employments, which are either rare and more solemn, or
daily and more usual: these latter too are of two sorts, either common
to both Sexes, or peculiar to one. Of those that are proper to men Hunting
is the cheif, for in this Countrey that exercise is lawfull to none but men:
<i>Olaus Magnus</i> is of the contrary opinion, and saies Lib. 4. Cap. 12. that
there is here such a multitude of Beasts, that the men alone, without the
help of women, dare not go out to hunt; and therefore they are as active
in this sport, if not more than men. I beleive he had not this from any good
tradition, or his own knowledg, but rather followed the authority of some
ancient Writers, as <i>Procopius</i> Lib. 2. <i>Gothic.</i> or <i>Tacitus de mor. Ger.</i> for
whatsoever they say concerning the <i>Fenni</i> and <i>Scritfinni</i>, is so far from
being true of the <i>Laplanders</i>, that they do not permit women so much
as to touch their hunting weapons or beasts brought home, and debar them
all passage at that door thro which they go to that sport, as will be shewed
hereafter. They observe in hunting many things with great superstition, as
not to go out upon ominous daies, such as S<sup>t</sup> <i>Marks</i> (whom they call <i>Cantepaive</i>)
S<sup>t</sup> <i>Clements</i> and S. <i>Catherines</i>, because they believe on these daies
some misfortune will happen to their weapons, and that they shall have no
good success all the year after. They think they cannot prosper, unless
they have first consulted their Gods by their Drum, which they use before
their going out, and have therefore severall beasts pictured upon it. This
is chiefly before the hunting a Bear. The third observation is that they will
not go out at the usual door, but at one in the backside of the house called
<i>Posse</i>, I suppose it is to avoid women, the meeting of whom is an ill omen
to huntsmen, and therefore they are forbidden to come on that side of the
house where this door is, as <i>Ol. Matthias</i> assured me while I was writing
this, who was very well acquainted with this Country. <i>Zieglerus</i> saies the
same, tho something obscurely, that a woman is not to go thro this door
that day her husband is hunting: but it is not only that day, but at no time
else. All these things are by way of preparation. The hunting it self is various
according to the time of year, and severall sizes of beasts. In the
Summer they hunt on foot with Dogs, which are very good in these parts,
not only for their scent, but that they dare set upon any thing, being still
tied up to make them more fierce. In the Winter they themselves run down
the game, sliding over the snow in a kind of scates, which I shall describe
more fully in another place. Little beasts they chase with bow and arrows,
the greater with spears and guns; tho sometimes they use other arts. That
sort of beast they call <i>Hermelines</i>, they take in traps as we do Mice, which
are so contrived of wood that the touching of any part makes them fall;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
sometimes in pits and holes covered with snow, to hide the deceit, as also
with Dogs that will gripe them to death. Squirrels they shoot with blunt
darts, that they may not do an injury to their skins, which they very
much esteem. After this manner also they take Ermines. Other beasts,
as Foxes, Beavers, they kill with Javelins spiked with iron: but if they
meet with a beast that hath a pretious skin, they are so expert at their
weapons, as to direct the blow where it will do it least harm. Foxes
are frequently tempted with baits upon the snow strowed upon twigs over
deep pits, or caught in gins laid in their usuall haunts, or else poisoned
with a sort of moss, which is peculiar for this use, but is seldome made use
of where there are abundance of field Mice, which are the Foxes generall
food. They fasten snares to boughs of trees to catch Hares in, and some
of the above mentioned beasts: and if any one find any thing fast in these,
he is obliged to give notice to the owner. I come now to the larger beasts,
of which Wolves are most commonly caught in holes, but sometimes shot
with bullets: these are their game frequently because they have the greatest
plenty of them, and suffer the most dammages by them: and for their
greater destruction, Sithes are often hiden under the snow to cut off their
legs. After this manner too Leopards and Gulo’s are destroyed, which is
now a daies almost left off, because the Countrey is so well furnished with
guns, with which they also kill Elkes when they can find them. But with
greatest care and diligence they hunt Rain-deers and Bears, the former with
all kind of weapons. At their rutting time in Autumn, about S. <i>Matthews</i>
day, they entice them to their tame does, behind which the Huntsman lies
to shoot them. And in the Spring, when the Snow is deep, the men themselves
slide after them, and easily take them, or sometimes drive them into
traps with Dogs: or lastly they set up hurdles on both sides of a way, and
chase them in between them, so that at last they must necessarily fall into
holes made for that purpose at the end of the work. The hunting of
the Bear follows, which, because it is done with the most ceremonies
and superstitions, will require the more care and accurateness in the relating
of it.</p>

<p>First of all, their business is to find out where the Bear makes his
den against Winter. He that finds it is said <i>hafwa ringet bioern</i>, i.e. to
encompass the Bear. He usually after this goes to all his friends and acquaintance
with much joy, to invite them to the hunting as to a solemn
and magnificent feast, for, as is before said, this beasts flesh is a great
delicacy. But they never meet before <i>March</i> or <i>April</i>, till they can use
their sliding shooes: at which time he chooses the best drummer among
them, and by his beating consults whether the hunting will be prosperous
or no, which done they all march into the field in battel array after him
that invited them as Captain, who must use no other weapon then a club,
on whose handle is hung an Alchymy ring. Next him goes the drummer,
then he that is to give the first blow, and after all the rest as
their office requires, one to boil the flesh, another to divide it, a third
to gather sticks and provide other necessaries: so they strictly observe that
one should not incroach upon anothers office. When in this order they are
come to the den, they set upon the Bear valiantly, and kill him with spears
and guns, and presently sing in token of victory thus, <i>Kittulis pourra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Kittulis ii skada tekamis soubbi iælla zaiiti</i>, that is, <i>they thank the Bear for
coming</i>, <i>and doing them no harm in not breaking their weapons</i>, in the singing
of which their Captain is the cheif Musician. After celebration of their
victory, they drag the Bear out, beating him with staves, whence they have
a Proverb, <i>slao bioern med riis</i>, that is, <i>the Bear is beat</i>, which signifies he
is killed. Then putting him upon a sledge, they draw him with Rain-deers
to the Hut where he is to be boiled, singing <i>Ii paha talki oggio, ii paha talka
pharonis</i>, that is, <i>they beseech the Bear that he would not raise tempests against
them, or any way hurt them that killed him</i>. This they say by way of jest,
unless we will suppose them (as some of them really do) to imagine the
killing of some kind of wild beast portends ill to the hunter. <i>Samuel Rheen</i>
speaks of a different song from this we have mentioned, much to this purpose,
that they thank God for making beasts for their service, and giving
them strength and courage to encounter and overcome so strong and cruel a
creature, and therefore I beleive they may join them together and sing both.
That Rain-deer that brings home the Bear is not to be used by Women for
a year, and some say, by any body else. If there be materialls, near the
place where the Bear is kill’d, they usually build up a hovel there to boil
him in, or if not, carry him to a place that is more convenient, where all
their Wives stay to expect them, and as soon as the men come nigh them
they sing <i>Læibi ia tuoli susco</i>, that is they ask their wives to chew the bark
of the Alder Tree and spit it in their faces. They use this rather then
any other Tree, because when ’tis bruised between their teeth, it grows
red, and will dy any thing, and the men being sprinkled with this, as if it
were the Bears blood, seem to have gone through some notable exploit
not without danger and trouble. Then their wives aiming with one eye
through an Alchymy Ring spit upon them: <i>Samuel Rheens</i> opinion differs
only in this, that but one woman spits in the Captains face. This ceremony
is not done in the Hut where the Bear is kill’d, but at the back door:
for they build two Tents, one for the men where the Bear is to be drest,
and the other for the women in which they make the feast: where as soon
as the men come in, the Women sing <i>Kittulis pouro tookoris</i>, that is, they
thank their husbands for the sport they had in killing the Bear: so they sit
down men and women together to eat, but not of Bears flesh. Supper ended
the men presently depart into the other house, and dressing the Bear
provide another meal: and it is not lawful for any of those Hunters to ly with
his wife in three daies after, and the Captain in five. The Bears skin is his
that first discovers him. They boil the flesh blood and fat in brass Kettles,
and what swims they skim off and put in wooden vessels; to which are
fasten’d as many Alchymy plates as there are Bears killed. Whilst the meat
is boiling they all sit down in order about the fire, the Captain first on the
right hand, then the Drummer, and next he that struck the first blow; on
the left hand first the Wood-cleaver, then the Water-bearer, and after the
rest according to their place. This done the Captain divides it between
the Women and Men. In the division the Women must have none of the
posteriours, for they belong only to the men; neither is it lawful for a Woman
to come and fetch their division, but ’tis sent them by two men, who say
thus to them, <i>Olmai Potti Sueregislandi</i>, <i>Polandi</i>, <i>Engelandi</i>, <i>Frankichis</i>,
<i>i. e.</i> that they came a great way off, from <i>Swedland</i>, <i>Poland</i>, <i>England</i>, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
<i>France</i>; these men the women meet, and sing <i>Olmai Potti Sweregislandi</i>, <i>Polandi</i>,
<i>Engelandi</i>, <i>Frankichis</i>, <i>Kalka Kaubsis laigit touti tiadnat</i>, <i>i. e.</i> you
men that come from <i>Swedland</i>, <i>Poland</i>, <i>England</i>, or <i>France</i>; we will bind
your legs with a red list, and so they do. But if we believe <i>Samuel
Rheen</i> the Drummer divides the mens part to every one an equal portion.
When all the meat is eaten, they gather up the bones, and bury them together;
then the Captain hangs up the skin upon a pole, for the women
blindfolded to shoot at, they singing all the while <i>Batt Olmai Potti Sweregislandi</i>,
<i>Polandi</i>, <i>Engelandi</i>, <i>Frankichis</i>, <i>i. e.</i> we will shoot at him that came
from <i>Swedland</i>, &amp;c. but she that hits it first gets the most credit, and they
believe her husband will have the best fortune in killing of the next Bear.
She is also obliged to work in cloth with wire as many crosses as there are
Bears kill’d, and hang them upon every one of the hunters necks, which
they must wear three whole daies. It is the opinon of the aforesaid Author,
that all the women do the same, and the men wear them four daies: he saies
also that the <i>Raindeer</i> that brought home the Bear must have one cross. I
cannot as yet find any other reason of this ceremony, but that they suppose
these crosses to be preservatives aginst all the dammages they can receive
from the Gods of the Woods for killing their Bear: for to this day they
are of the opinion that some Gods have taken charge of some beasts, especially
of the Bear, because he in this country is King over all the rest. After
the time of abstinence is exspired, the close of all this solemnity, is the
mens returning to their wives, which is thus; All after one another take hold
of that rope, to which they hang their Kettle, and dance thrice round the fire,
and so run out of the mens Tent into the womens, where they are met with
this song, <i>Todna Balka Kaino oggio</i>, we will thro a shovel full of ashes upon
your legs. <i>Samuel Rheen</i> speaking of this custome, saies the men must not
go to their wives till it be done, as if it were an expiation for their uncleanness
in killing a Bear. Thus you see with how many Laws and superstitions
they Hunt this Beast, some of which are common in hunting of others, as
the not admitting women to the sport, and debarring them from touching
the prey when it is taken, as also that the men return home through the
back door. And here ’tis observable that they never carry in Beasts, Birds,
or Fishes, but throw them in before them, without doubt out of superstition
that they may seem to drop from Heaven and be sent by providence: tho
most of them know not the original of such superstitious ceremonies, but only
follow the example of their forefathers. In fine nothing is accounted
here a greater credit or honor to a man then the killing of a Bear, and therefore
they have public marks for it, every one lacing his cap with as many
wires as he has kill’d Bears.</p>

<p>I come now to their fowling, which is proper also to men, and is alterable
according to the time of year or largness of the fowl, for in the Summer
they shoot altogether, but in the Winter catch in Snares and Springes, especially
the <i>Lagopus</i> call’d by the <i>Swedes</i> <i>Sniæriper</i>. They make kind of hedges
with abundance of holes in them, in which they set Springes, so that this
Bird being most upon the ground, and running about, is easily caught in
them: as for the taking of other Birds there is nothing worth a particular
observation.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the</i> Laplanders <i>Weapons, and other instruments of Hunting</i>.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">By the former Discourse it plainly appears that in hunting they use
severall Instruments and Weapons, in our next therefore it will be
requisite to give some account of them. The first and most frequent is a bow
three ells long, two fingers broad, and an inch thick, being made of Birch
and Pine (which by reason of the resine in it is very flexible) and covered
over with Birch bark, to preserve both from the weather. What <i>Lomenius</i>
saies of its being made of Rain-deers bones, must needs be false, since no bone
can be so pliable as is required in the making of a bow; his words are
these, <i>Rangiferi asperantur ossa in cultros &amp; curvantur in arcus congeneribus
feris trucidandis</i>, if he had left out <i>&amp; curvantur in arcus</i> he had spoke more
to the purpose: but I believe he had this, besides many other things, to fill up
his Journall from <i>Olaus Magnus</i>, who among the utensils these People have
from the Rain-deers, saies the Fletchers much desire their bones and horns,
from whence <i>Lomenius</i> collects that bows are made of them. But it is evident
that <i>Olaus</i> meant not this bow, but a kind of cross-bow termed by the
Germans <i>Armbrust</i>, and the French <i>Arbalestre</i>, which is impossible to be
made of bone, but the handle might be adorned with it, because in these
Northern parts they have no mother of Pearle, which other Countries perhaps
make use of to this purpose. It was then a good plain wooden long-bow,
which would not require an engine to bend it, but might be drawn with an
hand only. And since I told you it was made of two pieces of wood, we will
see next how they were joined together, which is with a kind of glew made of
Perches skin well scaled, that melts in using like ours. They have also steel-bows,
which are so strong, that when they bend them they must put their foot
in a ring for that purpose at the head of them, and draw the string up to the
nut, made of bone in the handle, with an iron hook they wear at their
girdle. From their bows I pass to their darts and arrows, which are of two
sorts, either pointed with iron to kill the larger beasts, or blunt without
it like bolts, to kill the smaller. These points are not alwaies made of iron,
but sometimes bones, which are fastned with glew into a hole bored with
a hot iron at the end of a staff, and afterwards sharpened with a knife, or
on a whetstone. But besides they use Guns, which they (as hunters do in
other places) with a great deal of superstition enchaunt that they should
never miss. These are made at <i>Soederhambn</i>, a town in <i>Helsingia</i>, famous
for weapons, from whence the <i>Bothnians</i> buy them, and sell them to the
<i>Laplanders</i>: hence they have Gun-powder and bullets, or at least lead to
make them: and sometimes <i>Norway</i> furnishes them with all these. Spears they
use only in hunting Bears, and are so little different from ours that they
will not need a description. I come now to their other instruments relating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to this sport, the cheifest of which are their shoes, with which they slide
over the frozen snow, being made of broad planks extremely smooth; the
Northern People call them <i>Skider</i>, and by contraction <i>Skier</i> (which agrees
something with the <i>Germans</i> <i>Scheitter</i>, that is, cleft wood) and sometimes
<i>Andrer</i> or <i>Ondrur</i> or <i>Skiidh</i>. Their shape is, according to <i>Olaus Magnus</i>,
five or six ells long, turned up before, and a foot broad: which I cannot
believe, because I have a pair which are a little broader, and much shorter,
and <i>Wormius</i> had a pair but of three ells long. And those are much shorter
which are to be seen at <i>Leiden</i>, which <i>Frisius</i> saies are just seven foot long,
four inches and a little more broad: and it must needs be so to hold with
<i>Olaus Magnus</i>, and every bodies opinion, that one shoe must be longer
than the other by a foot, as if the man or woman be eight foot high, one
must be eight foot, and the other nine. <i>Frisius</i> saies they are both of a
length at <i>Leiden</i>, and <i>Olaus Wormius</i> takes no notice of any difference in
his, but I believe then those were of two Parishes, for my biggest is just
such an one as <i>Frisius</i> describes covered over with resin or pitch, and the
shorter plain. But because the larger is of greatest use, it is no wonder
that one or two of them were sent abroad for a pattern, but since those
at <i>Leiden</i> are both the biggest, they were not made for men so tall as <i>Frisius</i>
speaks of, they fitting men of six foot, which is a stature sometimes met
with in <i>Lapland</i>. They are smooth and turned up before, not behind, as
they are pictured in <i>Wormius</i>, not by the fault of the Author, but the Painter,
for the original in his study shews them otherwise; I have observed in my
longer shoe that it is not quite strait, but swells up a little in the middle
where they place their foot. <i>Frisius</i> did ill in giving a picture but of one,
and in that nothing of this bending, I will therefore describe both, and a
<i>Laplander</i> sliding in them.</p>

</div>

<p>These shoes are fastned to their feet by a with, not run through the bot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>tom
but by the sides, that it might not hinder their sliding, or wear out
with often using, which is not expressed in <i>Frisius’s</i> Picture, this is directly
in the middle, and ti’d to the hinder part of the leg, as you may see in the
figure. That which is often in <i>Olaus Magnus</i>, and set forth by <i>Frisius</i>, is a
meer fancy and figment of an Italian Painter, that could not understand
what these shoes were, but by describing them like long wooden broags
turning up with a sharp point before: which is very idle, because the
foot goes into it at the hinder part, and agrees not with <i>Olaus’s</i> other cuts;
for if the place of the foot were there, it could not endure so great a weight
before it, or effect that for which this shoe was first invented: for they
must tread firm upon the Snow, which they could not do if all the weight
lay at one end; but when ’tis in the middle, that which is before and behind
will keep the foot from sinking in. The way of going in them is this: they
have in their hand a long staff, at the end of which is a large round piece of
wood fasten’d, to keep it from going deep into the Snow, and with this they
thrust themselves along very swiftly. This way of running they not only
use in plain and even, but in the most rugged grounds, and there is no Hill or
Rock so steep, but with winding and turning they can at last come up to the
top, (which Pope <i>Paul</i> the Third could not believe) and that which is a
greater Miracle will slide down the steepest places without danger. These
shoes they cover with young <i>Rain-deers</i> skins, whose haires in their climbing
run like brisles against the Snow, and keep them from going back.
<i>Wormius</i> saies they were cover’d with Sea Calf’s Skins, but I believe he talk’d
of those, that the <i>Siæfinni</i>, or the Maritime people use. And this is the
first instrument of hunting, which they use as well in other businesses in
winter time, for they can pass no other way over the Snow, at which time
they can out run any wild beast. The other instrument they use is a sledg,
which altho it is fit for any journy, they use it in hunting especially the
<i>Rain-deeres</i>, the description of which, because ’tis fit for all manner of carriages,
I shall defer to another place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAP_XXI" id="CHAP_XXI">CHAP. XXI.</a><br />

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the</i> Laplanders <i>Handycraft-trades</i>.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Besides hunting, which is the cheifest, they have many other emploiments
relating to their lives and fortunes, of which Cookery is the
first: for what ever food they get by fishing, fowling, or hunting, the men dress
and not the women. They therefore are quite ignorant of this Art, (which
the men are not very expert at) and never use it but upon necessity, and in
the absence of men.</p>

<p>The second is the boat-makers, which they make of Pine or Deale boards,
not fasten’d with nails but sew’d together with twigs, as among the ancients
with thongs, <i>Olaus Magnus</i> and <i>Johannes Tornæus</i> sayes with roots of trees,
but most commonly with <i>Rain-deers</i> nerves. When they launch these boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
they caulk them with moss to keep out the water, and use sometimes two,
sometimes four oares, so fasten’d to pegs in the sides, that one man may row
with two.</p>

<p>The third trade is the Carpenters, to make sledges, which are not all of the
same shape, those they travel in, call’d <i>Pulca</i> being made in the fashion
of half a boat, having the prou about a span broad turned up, with a hole
in it to run a cord thro to fasten it to a <i>Rain-deer</i>, and the poupe of one flat
board: the body is built of many, which are fasten’d with wooden pegs to
four or five ribs; they never go upon wheeles, but are convex and round,
that they may roul any way, and more easily be drawn over the Snow. This
description agrees with that sledg which I have, and the Testimony of <i>Herberstenius</i>,
<i>Olaus Magnus</i>, and <i>Johannes Tornæus</i>. The fore part of them is
cover’d with Sea-Calfs skin for about an ell, stretch’d upon hoops, least
the Snow should come in, under which they put moss to keep their feet
warm. These are about three ells long, but those that carry baggage, called
<i>ackkio</i>, <i>ajefive</i>, are not cover’d any where. The people defend their goods from
the weather, according to <i>Wexionius</i>, with raw flax: but that is not probable,
because no flax grows there, and the use of flaxen garments is unknown,
and therefore I believe they do it with skins or bark. In <i>Olaus Magnus</i> lib.
17. cap. 25. there is a cart painted upon wheeles, the Author describes it
in these words, <i>qui domestici sunt Rangiferi curulibus plaustris aptantur</i>, but
what these <i>curulia plaustra</i> signifie he does not explain. And since the Painter
has drawn other things according to his own capacity, and understanding,
I do not know whether he has not follow’d his own opinion more then
<i>Olaus’s</i> narration, but ’tis certain there are no wheele carts, for what they
carry in Summer is put in dorsers upon <i>Rain-deers</i>. These Tradesmen make
their sliding shoes, which because I have describ’d in the former Chapter,
I need not now speak of.</p>

<p>The fourth is making boxes and chests to lay up weapons and other things
in, which are all of an oval shape, of which sort <i>Lodovicus Otto Bathoniensis</i>
gave me one. They are made of thin birch plancks, which are so contrived
and bent into an Oval, that the pegs or twigs, with which they are fasten’d,
are not perceiv’d. The lids are of one board, and for ornament often inlaid
with <i>Rain-deers</i> bones in diverse figures, which for better illustration you
shall see describ’d at the end of this Chapter in the cut markt with the
letter C.</p>

<p>The fift Trade is making Baskets, in which Art no Nation can compare
with them. The matter they make them off is roots of Trees, which they
work not as other people do, for they make them of what bigness they
please, and if occasion require, will be so accurate in their work as to interweave
the roots so neat and close together, that they shall hold water like
a solid vessel. Their shapes are diverse, some round with a cover and handle
to carry them by, and others squares or oblongs. Not only the <i>Laplanders</i>
and <i>Swedes</i> use these, but they are also for their curiosity and strength sent
into farther Countries: the figure B. at the end will give a view of a round
one.</p>

<p>Beside these the men make all manner of houshold-stuff of wood or bone;
and particularly spoons, one of which I have with all its Rings and Ornaments,
as you may see at figure A. I have two weaving instruments, a shuttle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
about two inches long or more, with an hole at one end D. and a kind of
comb or small Loom in w<sup>ch</sup> they weave particular wreaths and ornaments E.</p>

<img src="images/zill_t102.jpg" width="569" height="800" alt="basket and other craft items" />
</a>
</div>

<p>They make also very neat Tobacco boxes carved with knifes in bone, with
many Rings and other pretty appendages about them, all which being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
considered will prove this Nation not to be so dull and stupid as by some it
is supposed.</p>

<p>They have also one Art more worth taken notice of, as ingraving flowers
and several Beasts in bone, into which they cast several plates of Tin, and with
these figures the men and women adorn their girdles and other things: the
same way they make their molds for casting bullets. They make instruments
for all emploiments, as Cookery, &amp;c. those for hunting are usually made of
bone, and others are commonly adorned with it. <i>Zeigler</i> mentions tubs,
which are rather cups, or vessels cut out of a stump of a Tree, as traies are:
and <i>Wexionius</i> mentions other vessels made of bark, but I forbear to speak
of any more, only I shall add that they learn their art not from masters but
their fathers according to their capacity.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Womens Emploiments.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Having run thro the mens emploiments, the womens are next to
be considered. Two trades are most peculiar to them, as doing the
work of Taylors and Shoomakers, for they make and mend all the
Clothes, Shoes, Boots and Gloves; and they have a third the making
all those things that join the Rain-deer to the sledg, as collars, traces,
&amp;c. in order to which they learn subservient arts, as making thred, which is
commonly of Rain-deers nerves, because they have no flax: of this sort I
have some by me. <i>Olaus Magnus</i> saith <i>ad indumentorum usum</i>, for the making
of shirts, which made <i>Lomenius</i> believe the women wove this thred into
cloth, who I perceive in his short description of <i>Lapland</i>, hath very closely
followed his words more then his sense. In the making of their thred, which
is of about 3 ells long, the extent of the Rain-deers nerves, they first
cleanse the nerves, then having cut off all the hard parts, they dry, and
hatchell them, and lastly mollify them with fishes fat. Besides this they spin
wool for swadling clothes, and Hares fur, with which they knit caps, as
in other parts of <i>Europe</i> they do stockins with four knitting needles, which
art the <i>Germans</i> call <i>stricken</i>. These Caps are as soft as Swans down, and
extremly warm. In the same manner they make Gloves, which are very beneficiall
to them in the cold. The work of their fillets is very curious, for
they put in them many figures, as you may see at the end of the foregoing
Chapter, at the figure I. The fourth trade is their covering thred with tin,
which first they draw into wire by pulling it thro little holes in horn with
their teeth, which holes they fill half up with bone, that the tin may be flat
on one side, and fitter to be put on thred. The picture of a woman drawing
wire you have in the next page. Then they put it upon the nerves by the
help of a spindle, which doth so twist them together that they seem all tin,
and when they have done, they wind it about their head or foot, least it should
entangle and be spoiled. And this is their way of making thred of tin, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
other Countries of gold and silver, the chiefest use of which is in adorning
their clothes after the way of Embroidery, which is the womens fifth art.
<i>Ziegler</i> adds to this <i>faciunt vestes
intextas auro &amp; argento</i>, that
they interweave in their clothes
gold and silver, which I cannot
believe, because they do not do
so now, and whatever is spoke
of the mettal, they weave neither
linnen nor woollen, but
buy it from the <i>Bothnian</i> or <i>Norway</i>
Merchants: so then they do
not weave this thred into their
garment, but embroider them
with it. Thus they adorn all
their vestments, as gowns called
<i>Muddar</i>, boots, gloves and shoes,
and she that doth it neatest, is
preferred before other women,
and had in greater estimation.
They do not immediately put
this upon the fur of skins, but lists of blew, green, or red woollen cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Their gowns are embroidered about the neck, sleeves, breast, and sides;
gloves about the tops, shoes; instep and toes; boots, about the knees; in
which work they commonly picture; Stars, Flowers, Birds, Beasts, especially
Rain-deers: and to make their clothes more glorious, they set them
with spangles, fillets, points, and knots of this thred, and wear upon their
head shreds of diverse colored cloth, the pictures of all which you have
in the former Chapter, Boots F, Gloves G, Shoes H. The Rain-deers
harness they embroider in the same manner.</p>

<p>Lastly they have nothing that appears in sight, but it is hereby made very
commendable and ingenious. I have by me men and womens scrips, pin-cases,
sheaths for knives, very curiously wrought. Of all which, that I might
not seem to give too a large commendation of them, I have put the Pictures
in the foregoing page.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Emploiments common to both Sexes.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">The other buisinesses, which we have not treated of yet, whether they
be at home or in journies, belong to both Sexes, and that they may be
the better undertaken, men and women wear breeches, and as <i>Joh. Tornæus</i>
takes notice, equally undergo all pains and work excepting hunting: by
which words <i>exceptâ venatione</i> he doth not deny but men and women have
peculiar emploiments. In their travels the master of a family goes first, with
his baggage and Rain-deers after him, and next him his wife with hers; in
Summer they both walk on foot, in Winter both are drawn in sledges,
which I have described in the next page: in these they like children are tied
and bound fast with fillets and cords, especially when in hast, having only their
hands and head at liberty, and their back leaning against the end. The Rain-deer
is not harnessed like an Horse, but hath a strong cloth about his neck,
to which is fastened a rope that goes between his fore and hind feet, to the
hole in the prou of the sledge. He therefore that drew <i>Olaus Magnus</i> pictures
was much deceived, when he made Rain-deers joined to the sledge with
traces on both sides, and such a collar about their necks, as is used in
other Countries upon their thillers; and in another place two yoaked together
drawing a cart with wheels, which is a thing unknown to the <i>Laplanders</i>,
and men riding upon them as on a Horse, whereas they never do
so, but walk on foot, and carry their goods only on them in dorsers. He that
is drawn rules the beast, not with a bridle, but an halter made of Sea-dogs
skin tied about his head or horns, fastned to a stick which he holds in one
hand, with which he removes the thong to either side, according as he
would go or turn: with the other he guides the sledge, for it being round
at bottom is still wavering, so that he which rides, must still with the motion
of his body, and hand, take care it overturns not, as you may see in the
picture. When they thus travel in the Winter, the <i>Rain-deer</i> are bravely
adorned with needle work of tin-thred upon diverse colour’d cloth, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
their necks and back, and a bell, with which they are mightily pleased. They
travell in these at what rate they will; but if upon a remove, alwaies slow,
because of the weight of their goods, in which journies the man and his
wife go first, and all the family come after. <i>Ziegler</i> saies in 24 houres
they can go 150 miles: <i>Herbersternius</i> saies in a day 20 <i>German</i> miles: but
’tis not to be believed that it is performed with one <i>Rain-deer</i> in the day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
12 hours, except the waies be good and slippery, but they ordinarily go 12
14 or 16 <i>German</i> miles in ten hours, which number doubled will make out
<i>Zeigler</i>’s opinion: and that not with one <i>Rain-deer</i> which is impossible to
out so long, but that it must dy or be left to rest the next day. In this
way of travelling the Women are as expert as the men, and <i>Olaus Magnus</i>
saies more. As the men and women travel together, so they help one another
in fishing, and at baiting time to feed their cattle, which is evident in the
<i>Rain-deer</i>, for the women take as much care of them as the men, and equally
take the trouble to milk them: and in fishing ’tis manifest; for women in
the absence of men, are very intent for some weeks at catching fish, which they
gut and dry up for Winter. Their way of catching them is with Nets, and
other instruments, as every where else. I know not what <i>Paulus Jovius</i>
meant, when he said they have a foolish way of fishing, except he refers to
their hooks which are nor of Iron but Wood: they make them of <i>Juniper</i> bent
round: these they fasten to sticks, and throw them into the Rivers, and very
easily take many large fishes. If they fish with a Cane or Whale-bone, the fisher
never knows when the fish bites, but pulls up at a venture. Their way of fishing
alters with the season, in the Summer usually with drag nets, between
two boats, or else with spears like Tridents, but that they have more teeth.
With these they strike pikes, especially when they ly sunning themselves
near the top of the Water: they do the same by Night burning dry wood
at the prow, by which light the Fish are enticed thither. In the Winter
time they thrust nets under the ice to a banck side, and then by a great noise
above drive the Fish to them; all these things the Women often do alone,
which is the less to be wondered at, because every where in this Country
there is a great multitude of Fish. Besides all these, they carry and cleave
wood, and make hedges, with such like works, which are so inconsiderable
as not to be worthy to enlarge our discourse.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Divertisements.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Having spoken of their ordinary emploiments, it will not be amiss
here to annex something of their Divertisements: where first we may
note, that the people of this Country are generally dispos’d to idleness, not
willing to take any great paines, unless when meer necessity constrains them
to provide against want. This they seem to derive principally from their
Ancestors the Finlanders, as is elsewhere said. To which as well their cold
constitution by reason of the sharpness of the Air in this Country (that it
self is sufficient to dispose men to laziness,) as the length of their Nights,
and indulgence to much sleep, may contribute not a little. In fine, that I
may omit their many other infirmities, whereby they are incapacitated to
undergo any considerable hardship, they are lovers of sloth and wholly
given up to it. But further, to consider how they bestow their vacant time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
from business, ’tis the general and most recieved accompt, that making and
receiving visits, and familiar conversation become the greatest part of their
recreations. For whereas their manner of life so nearly resembles solitariness,
that each family seems confined to its own hut, they can take no greater
satisfaction in any thing then such mutual entercourse. And here it
may be observed, that in their discourses at these meetings of friends and
acquaintance, usually the most ordinary affairs and daily occurrences
have the chiefest place: as particularly their welfare, emploiments, and the
like. But besides ’tis their humor to make remarks upon the transactions of
all forreiners, whose names or customes commerce has at any time brought
to their knowledg. And furthermore they can take no greater pride, then
either in traducing the management of their affairs, or imposing drollish
Nick-names upon them. Tho indeed those of the richer sort are used to
entertain their visitants with greater merriment and magnificence. Besides
these visits they use some sports wherewith they recreate themselves, especially
in Winter (when for some space of time they live as scateringly as in
Summer, but are more familiar,) or at their public assemblies in the places
of Judicature and Fairs. Again some sports are looked upon as only peculiar
to men, others the female Sex also have their part in. Of the first sort
this is one. They make a line in the Snow, in place of a goal: behind it at
some paces distance they set up a mark, from whence each person taking
a run to the goal, and there taking his rise, throws his body as far as possibly
he can, and he that at one leap compasses the greatest space of ground,
is reckon’d the Conqueror. In this first sport they both leap and run. Another
they have where the trial of skill consists in leaping only, and that too
not in length but height; there stand two men upright, at no great distance
the one front the other, and hold in their hands sometimes a rope, sometimes
a pole, now higher, now lower, as is agreed upon by the combatants, usually
at the common height of a man: then each Person attemts to leap over
from a station assign’d, and he that performs most dextrously, gains the
applause to himself. A third sort of sport among them is with bow and arrows.
At a convenient place they set up a mark of a very small bigness, and
shoot at it with arrows from any distance prescrib’d. He that hits either
soonest or oftnest, bears away the bell from the rest. These sports hitherto
mentioned are almost instituted by them meerly for the consideration of credit
and renown: yet sometimes they play for prizes such as they agree upon
among themselves, and instantly they lay them down in the place where
they keep their games. Their prizes are seldom mony, usually skins, especially
of Squirrels, sometimes one, sometimes more as they see convenient
and agree upon it. But in those sports wherein as well the women as men
are plaiers, they commonly play with a leather ball stuffed with hay, about
the bigness of ones fist; whatever company of men and women is there present,
is sorted into two sides, one whereof seizes on this ground, the other
on another opposite to it, and at some distance off. Then every Person of
one side in his turn, beats the ball with a club thorough the Air, those of
the contrary side catching it at the fall; and if any one chance to catch it in
his hands, before it touch ground, then the order of the play is inverted,
and this side strikes out the ball, the other is fain to catch. Thus play the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
men and women, the boies and girles together, nor do the men shew themselves
more expert at it then the women. They besides have another play
at ball: in the hard frozen snow they draw two lines at some distance from
one another, then all the multitude both of men and women parting into
two sides, one applies it self to the defence of this, the other of that line;
then they meet in the middle space between their two goals, and fling down
the ball, then each partie with bandies and clubs strives to strike the ball
cross the opposite parties line, each party still maintaining the defence of
its own line; but if one side chance to strike the ball with their bandies over
the others line (for it is foul play to fling it with their hands) and so take
their goal, that is accounted the conquering side. The sports as yet mentioned
are such as belong to the younger sort, as well as to those of more
mature age: the next is peculiar to these last and only to men. Their custom
is to separate themselves into two companies, and attacque one another
by wrestling: first each company stands like a file of Soldiers all along in
order to confront the adverse company: then each man catches his adversary
by the girdle, wherewith all <i>Laplanders</i> are alwaies girt, as is elswhere
shown, (their girdle goes six times round their body, and so is fast and fittest
for their purpose,) so each man having caught hold, endeavors to fling
the other down, which they are not allowed to attempt by craft or deceit, as
by any lock or the like; Any one that is found delinquent in this kind, is
branded for a fowl plaier, and excluded the lists. These are the sports that
are almost peculiar to the <i>Laplanders</i>: besides them they use some, which
they borrow from other places, such is playing at Cards, a sport sufficiently
known thorough all <i>Europe</i>, for even the <i>Laplanders</i> take no little satisfaction
in it: they procure their Cards of the Merchants that trade thither.
They use likewise to play at dice, which they themselves make of wood
after the common fashion, with this only difference, that whereas dice commonly
have some number of spots inscribed on every side, they have a figure
made only on one side like an X. he wins in this sport, that casting
two Dies, on the top of either can show the X. their stakes are usually
Squirrils skins, or some small trifles, and in the failance of these leaden bullets,
which they use in their hunting to charge their Guns withal: and it
happens sometimes that a fellow having lost all his bullets, in hope of repairing
his damage by winning again, not only at present will be sensible of
the harm, but being disappointed of his Hunting puts to stake and looses
his future acquisitions and hope of livelihood. These are the usual waies,
whereby the people of <i>Lapland</i> spend their leisure times and divert themselves.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Contracts and Marriages.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">We have hitherto taken a survey of their ordinary imploiments, and
such as are almost every day in use, as well those peculiar to each
Sex, as common to both; likewise of their Divertisements and sports,
wherewith they use to intermingle those emploiments: It remains that we
treat of those businesses, which do not every day occur, but are singular and
solemn, and undertaken upon special occasions. And first of what appertain
to their Marriages; Concerning them ’tis most memorable, that whenever
any person purposes to marry, ’tis his first business, to make search
after a Maid well stock’d with <i>Raindeers</i>. For the <i>Laplanders</i> have a custom,
(as shall hereafter more particularly be mentioned) of bestowing upon
their Children soon after their birth, some certain number of those <i>Raindeers</i>,
and their increase is accounted of, not as the Parents estate, but
the Childs portion. She therefore, that is best provided of them, is in most
likely-hood of meeting with an Husband. Nor have they regard to any
thing else, as either good breeding, or beauty, or other the common allurements
of woers. For they who dwell on a hard and barren soile are generally
solicitous concerning food, which because their <i>Rain-deer</i> afford, every
one thinks himself best secured against want when he is best provided of
them. As soon therefore as the young man has cast about him for a wife,
which is usually done at their public meetings for paying of taxes, or upon
the account of fairs; next he makes a journy to her parents, taking along
with him his father, if alive, and one or two more whom he thinks will be
most kindly welcome, but especially one who may declare his affections,
and win the favor of the Maids parents. When they arrive at the hut, they
are all kindly invited in, only the suiter is fain to wait at door, and bestow
his time in chopping wood, or some such trivial business, till he be summon’d
in also, for without express permission ’tis uncivil in him to enter.
When they have drank of the Spirit of Wine, which the spokes-man brings,
he applies himself to the management of his province, discloses the Suiters
affections to the Daughter, and makes his address to her Father, that he
will please to bestow her in Marriage upon him. Which that he may atcheive
with more success, he honors the Father with the greatest titles and names
of renown that he can devise, at every one bowing the knee, as if he were
treating with a prince. He stiles him with the High and Mighty Father, the
Worshipful Father, as if he were one of the Patriarcks, the best and most
illustrious Father, and no doubt if they were acquainted with the Roial title
of His Majestie, He would not scruple to call him, the most Majestic Father.
The Wine, that the Suiter is supposed to have brought along with
him therewith to pay his respects to her parents, whom he pretends to,
they call either <i>Pouristwyn</i> (that is) the Wine of prosperous access, or
that Wine wherewith he designs to caress his Father and Mother in Law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that are to be; or else, <i>Soubowiin</i> (that is) the Wine of wooers which tis expedient
for wooers to bestow, thereby to procure permission of converse
with the daughter, and gain the favour and liking of the future Bride. But
we must take notice, that the business is nor proposed to the maid her self
first, but her parents; nor may the Suiter have any conference with her
without their permission. Nay ’tis the usual custom, at this time to dispatch
her away upon some sleevless arrand, either to the <i>Rain-deers</i> pastures
in the Woods, or a Neighbors hut, so as neither the Suiter nor any
of his company may have a sight of her; but if at last either she or some other
woman procure leave for Her of her Parents or kindred, to speak to him,
their entertainment finished he gets him out of the hut to his sledg,
and then takes out his woollen Cloth-Garments, (such as they use to spruce
themselves up withal, at their public Festivals, or more solemn affairs) and
what else is requisite to the present business: when he has trimm’d himself
up, he makes his address to his Mistress and salutes her. Their manner of
Salutation is by a kiss; in which that they mainly aim at is, that each not
only apply his mouth to the others, but also that both their noses touch;
for otherwise it goes not for a true salute. Next he makes her a present of
the rarest delicacies that <i>Lapland</i> affords, the <i>Rain-deers</i> tongue, the
Beavers flesh, and other dainties, which she refuses to accept of in the presence
of any body; presently after she is call’d aside to some convenient
place without the hut, then if she profess her self willing to receive them,
the Suiter farther puts it to her, whether she will grant him leave, that he
may take his repose by her in the hut; if she grant it, ’tis concluded between
them of their future marriage: withal he presents his gifts above mentioned.
If she rejects his suit, she casts them all down at his feet. The Bridegroom
usually carries them in his bosom, before he presents them. The full
approbation of the Parents, and the celebration of the wedding is used
oftentimes to be deferr’d for a considerable while, sometimes for two or
three years together; and all that while they bestow upon courting their
Mistresses. The reason why their time of Courtship or wooing proves so
long, is because the Bridegroom is necessitated to gratifie with frequent presents,
the parents and friends nearest in blood to the Bride, without the
leave of each of which he cannot compass the possession of her. This is expressed
by <i>Samuel Rheen</i> in these words, When any Person pretends marriage
to the Daughter of one of the richer sort, he is obliged to make a present
to her parents and nearest Kinsmen, such as is made for state to Ambassadors
or cheif Officers, as large as his means will reach to, which present
they call <i>Peck</i>, that is, Peices, every peice at least must contain two marks
of silver, that is, six ounces, there are some too, that must contain twenty,
forty, sometimes threescore ounces a peice, such peices the Bridegroom
is bound to bestow upon His Mistresses parents and her near kindred. In
what things these presents particularly consist, I shall mention hereafter,
for they do not give barely silver, but moulded into some fashion, or other
things besides; while therefore the Bridegroom is emploied in procuring
these pieces, ’tis no inconsiderable while that passes.</p>

<p>In this interval he ever and anon makes a visit to his Mistress, to whom
while he is travelling he solaces himself with a Love Song, and diverts the
wearisomness of his journy. And ’tis their common custom, to use such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
kind of Songs, not with any set tune, but such as every one thinks best
himself, nor in the same manner, but sometimes one way, sometimes another,
as goes best to every man, when he is in the mode of singing. An
ensampel of one they use in the Winter season, communicated to me by
<i>Olaus Matthias</i>, a <i>Laplander</i>, I here annex.</p>

<p>This is a love Song of the <i>Laplanders</i>, wherewith they incourage their
Rain-deers to travell nimbly along. For all delay, tho in it self short, is
tedious to lovers. They use too at other times to entertain themselves with
such Sonnets, when at some distance from their Mistresses, and therein to
make mention of them, and extoll their beauty. One of this kind I received
of the said <i>Olaus</i>, and seeing we have lit upon this subject, I here

<p>As they come to visit their Mistresses, they are necessitated to bring along
with them some spirit of Wine, as a singular and most acceptable present,
and Tobacco too. But if in the mean while, as it often falls out, the
father intends not to bestow his daughter upon the man that hath made pretensions
to her, he seldom refuses them, but defers the positive answer till
the year following, that he may the oftner entertain himself with the spirit
of Wine the Suiter brings along with him. And thus he delaies his answer
from one year to the other, till the Suiter perceive himself cheated, and
be constrained to require at his hands his charges made to no purpose.
There is then no other remedy to be taken, then bringing the business before
the Judg, where the Maids Father is sentenced to refund either the
entire sum, or half of it, as the case stands. Where withal we must observe
this, that the expences made by the Suiter on the Spirit of Wine, at his first
arrival, do not fall under this compensation, but he alone stands to the loss
of that. But if after the downright refusal of the Maid, he of his own accord
will show his liberality, he may try what luck he will have at his own peril.
If all things happen conformable to his wishes, then some set day is
appointed for the wedding. The day before it, all the kindred and Neighbors
as well of the Bridegroom as Bride resort to her parents hut, and the
Bridegroom presents them all with wedding gifts, about which they had
agreed, and of which mention is made above.</p>

<p>The Bridegroom is bound to present the Father with a silver cup, to
drink in; this is the first of those they call <i>Stycke</i>. The second is a large
Kettle, either of Copper or Alchymy. The third, a bed or at least hansom
bedding. The presents for the Mother are, first a girdle of silver, secondly
a Robe of honor such as they use to call <i>Vospi</i>. Thirdly a Whisk, which they
wear about their neck, and let it hang down to their brest, interlaced all
about with bosses of silver, and this they call <i>Krake</i>. These are the presents
for the Father and Mother: besides he bestows upon the Brothers, Sisters,
and all the near kindred, silver spoons, silver bosses, and some other such
kind of things of silver, for each of them must be presented with some gift
by the Bridegroom, if he mean to obtain his Bride. These are the presents,
which the Bridegroom is more especially bound to make to his Father and
Mother in law that are to be, and the rest of the kindred. And he makes
them in his father in laws hut, in the sight of all there. The day following
the wedding is celebrated, first by the ceremonious joining of the Priest
in the Church, afterwards by a set dinner. The new Wife together with
the Bridegroom walk along, both dress’d in the best clothes they can procure
at their own charges. For ’tis looked upon among them as unhansom to
make use of the borrowed cloths of others, unless it be wool as I have elswhere
shown. They take saies <i>Tornæus</i> so great pleasure in good cloth of what ever
color, that as far as their patrimony will permit, they procure their extraordinary
apparel and festival Garments of that kind: who declares expressly
that their festival apparel, or that which they wore on more solemn daies,
was not of skins but rich cloth. These Garments the Bridegroom girds up
with a silver girdle, but the Bride first looses her hair: and the fillet wherewith
she bound it up together before, she gives to the Virgin that is next a
kin to her: afterwards, on her bare head, and loose hair she puts a kind of a
silver fillet gilt over, or two, such as is the womens custom to wear at o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>ther
times besides, instead of a Garland or Coronet, so that by how much
this fillet is looser, then to environ only her head; so much it hangs down
the more behind: likewise about her middle they put on a silver girdle.
This is the Brides apparel, unless that sometimes they put upon her head
something of linnen, instead of a veil, which at other times the women use
when they have a mind to make themselves extraordinary gallant, for as for
what appertains to their garments, we have before observed, that both the
Bridegroom and Bride wear their own, and those their best, and such as
on festival daies they deck themselves withal. We have shown in another
place, that the womens were called <i>Volpi</i>, and were made either of wool, or
the richer sort of cloth, so that neither about this does <i>Olaus Magnus</i> in
his place a forecited, concerning the <i>Lapland</i> Bride, sufficiently agree
with their custom at this day. They set the Bride saies he, apparell’d in
<i>Ermins</i> and <i>Sables</i> skins on a <i>Rain-deer</i>. At this day both dress’d very
fine are carried to the Church or Priest, to be joined in Marriage; this was
not the custom in old times, if we give credit to <i>Olaus Magnus</i>, for then they
were joined at home, not by the Priests but the Parents, his words are
in <i>Lib.</i> 4. <i>Cap.</i> 7. in which place he treats of the <i>Laplanders</i> weddings,
as the Title of the Chapter informs us. In the presence of friends and kindred,
the Parents solemnly ratifie their Childrens Marriages, and that too
by the striking of fire with a flint and steel, particularly there he makes the
Parents joining them, and adds moreover the manner, viz. by fire striken
out of a flint, which without doubt as some other things, he cull’d out of
<i>Zeigler</i>, but as for the parents doing it, <i>Zeigler</i> has nothing of that, the
manner of their joining he explains in these words, They ratifie their Marriages,
and begin them in a ceremony of fire and flint, so pat a conjugal
mysterie, that they think nothing can be more agreeable, for as the flint conceals
within it self fire, which by concussion breaks forth, so in both sexes
there is life hid, which by the mutual coupling of marriage is propagated at
last to be a living ofspring. And just so <i>Olaus</i> has it, so that there can be
no doubt made but that he followed <i>Ziegler</i>. When they arrive near the
Church, they observe in their procession a certain order, first walk the Men,
the Women follow. The Men are led up by a <i>Laplander</i>, whom they call
<i>Automwatze</i>, or foreman, then follows the Bridegroom, after him the rest.
Some number of Virgins lead up the womens company, after them comes
the Bride led between a man and a woman, next to her follow the rest of
the women. Tis here to be observed that the Bride like one strugling against
it, and endeavoring the contrary, is dragged along by the man and woman
that are to wait upon her, and would seem to admit of her marriage with
great unwillingness and reluctancy, and therefore in her countenance makes
shew of extraordinary sadness and dejection: so afterwards in the Church
they are joined together by praiers and benediction according to the Christian
rite. After the same manner does <i>John Tornæus</i> relate this busines, only
that he saies the Bride is led by two men, her Father and Brother,
if alive, or otherwise by her two next Kinsmen. The portraicture of the
Bride in her wedding apparel, and with her two leaders you have in the
next page. After the solemnity of the marriage is ended, there follows
a wedding feast, that is made in her Parents hut, and as for the provision,
each of the persons invited contributes his share of the victuals, tho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
they bring it not thither just then, but the day before: when the Bridegroom
distributes his presents
to the Brides parents
and kindred, then every
one brings his victuals that
will be serviceable to the feast.
But because the meat they
bring is ordinarily raw, they
deliver it to a <i>Laplander</i>, on
purpose appointed to that
office, viz. to receive it of
every Person that brings, and
afterwards to boil it, and
lastly to distribute it among
the guests, tho commonly
the greatest part of the provision
be made, by the Bridegrooms
as well as Brides parents.
In their sitting at table
they keep this order, in
the uppermost places sit the
Bridegroom and Bride next
to one another, then follow in order the rest, as the parents, and kindred. At
the table no person helps himself, but receives his meat from the hands of a
<i>Laplander</i>, who is both dresser and carver of it. First of all he serves the Bridegroom
and Bride with their portion, and in order the rest. Now they who by
reason of the scantiness of room in the hut, cannot be admitted to the
feast, such are boies and girles, climb up to the roof of the hut, and from
thence let down threds with hooks tied to them, to which they fasten pieces
of meat, and the like, so that they also enjoy their share of the banquet.
The entertainment ended, they give thanks, as at other times they use, and
shake hands one with another. The last thing wherewith they shut up the
merriment of the feast, is drinking Spirit of Wine, which if they can light
upon, they then are sure to buy; first the Bridegroom drinks, then the Brides
parents, then each man shifts for himself, and so they make merry, but this
custom the richer sort only observe, and those too who have the opportunity
of buying, by the presence of those who sell these commodities; as for
the meaner sort they are accustomed to divert themselves with talk. When
the Wedding is over, the Husband may not take along with him his
Wife with her goods and fortune, but must remain for an whole year in service
with his Father; when that time is past, if he sees convenient he may
set up for himself, and turn housekeeper; and then the Father bestows upon
his Daughter at her departure, the <i>Rain-deer</i>, which are her due, because
given her in her younger years: he gives her also other gifts besides, and
what furniture will be requisite for the new married couple, particularly
he gives for her dowry an hundred or more <i>Rain-deers</i>, as likewise silver,
copper, Alchymy, a tent, bedding, and other houshold-stuff. And next
all the kindred, the Brothers and Sisters, and whoever have received of the
Bridegroom his gifts of respect, are likewise obliged to return him back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
again some present, so that he who had received one or two markes of silver,
returns for a gift again one or two <i>Rain-deers</i>: so that it comes to
pass, that the <i>Laplanders</i>, who can gratifie the friends and kindred with
numerous presents, if they wed a rich <i>Laplanders</i> Daughter, come to great
wealth in <i>Rain-deer</i> by this kind of marriage. These are the cheif things the
<i>Laplanders</i> observe in their contracts and marriages, which before we quite
leave, we may take notice first, that it is unlawful among them, to marry
a wife too near in blood. And they have so special a regard to the degrees
of consanguinity and affinity, that they never request marriage in the prohibited
ones. And again ’tis unlawful, having one wife to marry another,
or when one is married to put her away, by Divorce. Polygamy and Divorce
were never heard of among the <i>Laplanders</i>, neither in the time of
<i>Paganism</i>, saies <i>Tornæus</i>, nor afterwards, but they alwaies observed marriage
honestly and like Christians; yet in former daies perhaps they did not
altogether abhor the communicating their wives, whom they permitted to
strangers especially and guests. So indeed writes <i>Herberstenius</i>. But <i>John
Tornæus</i> mentions an instance of later date, and the Testimony too of a
<i>Laplander</i> of <i>Luhla</i>, tho he doubts to give credit to him. ’Twas reported
to me, saies he, that in the time of my Predecessor of <i>Luhla-Lapmark</i>, a
certain immodest <i>Laplander</i>, came to lodg with another, in <i>Torne-Lapmark</i>,
a civil honest man, as was his whole family, who could read books,
and lived a pious life, for which he was stiled by scorners <i>Zuan Bishop</i>. Then
the Man of <i>Luhla</i>, when he had disordered himself with drinking Spirit of
Wine, addressed himself to his hosts wife, in hope of debauching her, but
because there were there present two officers, who had Spirit of Wine to
sell, the <i>Zuan</i> Bishop call’d for them, and told them the fellows design,
desiring likewise that they being Ministers of the State, would apprehend
and bind him: they immediately bound him to a Tree, and left him there
for a whole Winter night together, to be frozen with cold. At last he was
forced to regain his liberty with mony; and pleaded it as an excuse, that it
was the custom in <i>Luli-Lapmark</i>, that if any person visited another, the
entertainer permitted such familiarity with his Wife. Thus saies <i>Tornæus</i>, but
doubtingly, for the fellow might have only framed this for his own excuse;
’tis certain no other person has taken notice of it in them of <i>Luhla</i>, and the
other <i>Laplanders</i> are so ignorant of this communion of their wives, that
they cannot endure they should look upon other men. The <i>Laplanders</i> dwelling
towards <i>Norway</i> at the river <i>Torna</i> are so jealous, that if a Woman
chance to meet a man, and speak but a few words to him, they immediatly
fall into a suspicion of her.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Child-bearing, and the Education of their Children.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Next to Marriage it will be expedient to treat of their Child-bearing,
and their Children. Where we may note first, that they
wish for nothing more, and that they take no greater plesure in any thing
then fruitfull Matrimony. And hence it is, I suppose, they are so prone
to lust, as is elsewhere shown: but altho they desire this so ardently, yet
they are very seldome fruitfull in Children, for they can scarce beget more
then eight, which number is the greatest, and usually they beget but
one, two, or three. An occasion of this their barreness, <i>Sam. Rheen</i>
imagines their bad diet, as likewise the extreme coldness of the Country,
which I think may be very true. He moreover adds Gods anger, which he
collects from this, because tho they are not worn away with War or Plague,
yet notwithstanding their Country is never the more populous, and their Nation
wasts rather daily. The motive of this anger he supposes to be their obstinateness
in maintaining their ancient impieties. They use indeed at this
very day, not only in Child-bearing, but other affairs too, to be solicitous
concerning the events, and to search after them by their superstitious rites.
Their first care is concerning the sex, for as soon as they perceive the wife to
be big with child, they have an opinion that they can inform themselves whether
it will prove a Boy or a Girl, after this manner: they forthwith view
the Moon (for they imagine that a Child-bearing woman bears some resemblance
to the Moon, as we shall hear) if there be a Star just above the Moon,
they thence collect that the burden will prove of the male sex, if below, of
the female. But I wonder they make a comparison between the Moon and a
woman with child. For can there be any account given of their resemblance?
is it, that like the Moon, she grows big with her burden, and when
that is laid, lessens again? I rather suppose that these are the reliques of
their Pagan superstition, which made the Moon the tutelar Goddess to
women with child. For so most of the Pagans did account other, which
opinion being outdated, they yet pretend some resemblance between them.
Their second care is touching the health or sickness of the child, which thing
also they suppose the Moon will inform them in. For if a Star be just before
the Moon, they take it for a sign that the child will prove healthfull,
and grow up to be a man. But if it comes just after her, they thence presage
that the child will be a very sickly one, and not long lived.</p>

<p>The woman with child laies her burden in a hut, but (which any body
may understand) a sufficient incommodious one, especially if the time of
her delivery happen to be in the Winter, for tho they have a fire kindled
in the middle of the hut, yet that can give her but little warmth. After
her delivery, her first restorative and cordial, is a good draught of Whales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fat, which they procure out of <i>Norway</i>, the tast of which is as strong and
ill savoured as of a Sea-calves lard, when dried. The child, as soon as brought
forth is washed over as in other Countries, but it is a peculiar custom of the
<i>Laplanders</i> that first they do it with cold water or snow, and then afterwards
dip them in hot water, when it begins to fetch its wind, and can scarcely
draw breath. And also they use to dip in the water all the other parts of
the body, the head only excepted; They heat water, saies <i>Sam. Rheen</i>,
in a Caldron, and in that they set the infant streight up to his neck, but
they let no water come upon his head, before such time as he is baptized
by the Priest. The newborn Babe is instantly wrapped up in an Hares
skin, instead of linnen swadling clothes.</p>

<p>The woman lying in, hath her peculiar place assigned her in the hut
where she lodges, till she recover her health. And it is just by the door usually
on the left hand: there is no other reason given for it then that this
part of the hut is less frequently disturb’d by company, and there they
have all things needfull for them administred. Tho this seldom resort thither
be rather, by reason of the womans lying in in that place, either because
they would not disturb her with their company, or, which I rather suppose,
because they look upon her at that time as unclean. But the women
of <i>Lapland</i> seldom keep their beds long after their delivery, and in that
while are extraordinary carefull touching the Baptism of their Infants: for
after they began more diligently to be instructed in the Christian Religion,
they take the greatest pains imaginable to have their Children baptized
as soon as possibly may be. In former times it was otherwise, most of
them then were baptized very late, and at their mature age; some deferred
it for altogether. Of this <i>Gustavus</i> the first is a witness, in his Charter, the
words whereof I have cited elsewhere. As touching the former <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>
in an other Charter and Preface, premised to that which he published
<i>Anno</i> 1634, in which the State of the Religion in <i>Lapland</i> is declared at
large; Baptism, saies he, is administred indeed to them but only at Winter,
if their young children can live till then, it is well; if not, they die without
Baptism. Some of their children come to years of Discretion before
it, so that with those that are grown up, there is no small paines to be
taken when they are to be baptized. The time of Baptism being the Winter
time, was because they have Sermons then preached to them, and the Sacrament
administred, and that no oftner then twice; once about New-years-day,
and againe at Lady-day, of which I have treated in another place.
Before these times there was not so much done as that, but the <i>Laplanders</i>
were fain to come with their Children to the neighbouring Churches of
the <i>Swedes</i> in <i>Angermannia</i> and <i>Bothnia</i>, of which <i>Olaus Magnus</i> must be
understood to speak, when he saies Lib. 4. c. 17. Once or twice in a year
they visit the Baptismall Churches, and bring along with them their sucking
Babes in Baskets tied to their backs, to be baptized. But at this day those
women that are able, and not impeded by some grievous sickness, carry
their Children to the Priest themselves, about a fourtnight after their delivery,
that by him they may receive Baptism. So much good hath building
Churches in <i>Lapland</i> done, and having Sermons there, not in a strange
Tongue, but the <i>Laplanders</i> proper own: and so zealous are they for
hastening their Childrens Baptism, that the Mother scarce lying in above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a week or fortnight, after her delivery, will undertake a most tedious
journy, over the tops of Mountains, thorough wide Marshes and high
Woods with her Infant to the Priest; for the women of this Country are
naturally hardy, and able to endure any thing without trouble, and therefore,
tho they feed upon course food in their sicknesses, and drink nothing
else but water, yet they recover again quickly. They carry their young
Infants to the Priest, one way in the Summer time, and another way in
the Winter. In Winter they lay it upon a sledge. In Summer they put it
in a Pannier fastned to the back of a Rain-deer. The Infant is not set
upon the back of the Raindeer, but is tied in his cradle, and fastned to
the pack saddle after this fashion.</p>

</a>
</div>

<p><i>Olaus Magnus</i> makes them put in Baskets, as his words afore quoted
do intimate, and those Baskets too to be tied at their backs, and the
Picture he makes of them represents not only the woman, but the man too
so laden, each with two Children a piece: so that together they travell
with four Children, and with wooden shoes on their feet; but here I am
afraid the Painter followed his own fancy too much. Certain it is that the
Baskets there represented, bear no resemblance to those of <i>Lapland</i>.
The <i>Laplanders</i> are wholly ignorant of this sort of Baskets, that are carried
at ones back. Nor are their Baskets like wooden square Boxes, such
as his figure represents them, but of a round compass, and one part shut
down upon the other, as I have said elsewhere. But to return to their
Baptism, in it they give their Children names, according to the names of
some of their friends and kindred. <i>Samuel Rheen</i> adds that they affect to
put Pagan names upon them, such as <i>Thor</i>, <i>Guaarm</i>, <i>Finne</i>, <i>Pagge</i>; but that
the Priests avert them from so doing as much as possibly they can. And this
is peculiar with them, that they often change their names, and put others
upon them then those that were given them at their Baptism, for the love
they bear to some friend or kinsman deceased, whose memory thereby they
desire to preserve. <i>Tornæus</i> too avouches the same thing, and if at any time
in their younger years they fall into sickness, then they use the name given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
them in Baptism instead of a surname, especially they observe this in boies.
But altho the <i>Laplanders</i> wives are hardy, so as to be able to undertake a
journy a week or two after their delivery, and to go about other emploiments,
tho they have made their public appearance, and have been churched
by the Priest, yet by their husbands they are looked upon as unclean, till
six weeks be accomplished, so that they admit of no familiarity or conjugal
society with them for all that space of time. And thus much of their child-bearing.</p>

<p>I proceed next to their Education of them, the first thing that occurs
here is their Nursing, which is alwaies by their own Mothers milk, for
the <i>Laplanders</i> make no use of Nurses. And this they do not only for some
small time, but usuall for two years, three or four together; but if sickness
or any other occasion happen, so that they cannot themselves suckle their
young ones, they give them the Rain-deers milk, which is grosser and
thicker, then they can well draw out of a suck-bottle, (as at sometimes they
are accustomed to do, elswhere) and for that reason, if the necessity be
urgent they give it in a spoon. Besides their Mothers milk, they instantly
accustom their young Infants, to eat flesh, for they thrust into their
mouths a piece of Rain-deers flesh, that they may suck the gravie out of it,
and so get nurishment.</p>

<p>The rocking the infant in his cradle, follows next, whereby they get him
a sleep. Their Cradles are made of the stock of a tree hollowed, like a
boat: these they cover with leather, and at the head they erect an arched
kind of roof, of leather likewise. In such a cradle they lay &amp; tie in the Infant,
without any linnen clothes or sheets, instead of which they lay him on a sort of
soft moss, of a red color, which they dry in Summer, and have great plenty of
it. When the Infant is to be rocked, they let the cradle hang by a rope from
the roof of the hut, and by thrusting the cradle and tossing it from one
side to the other, they lull him a sleep. They use likewise to please their
young children with some certain baubles, for at their cradles they tie some
rings of Alchamy, to make a noise and clinking. To these rings which serve
instead of rattles they moreover add some emblems, wherewith their children
may be timely admonished of their condition and future duty. If it be
a boy, they hang up at his cradle a bow and arrows, and a spear made very
artificially out of Rain-deers horn, whereby they signifie, that their children
must diligently practise to be expert and ready in using the bow and
spear. If it be a girle; the wings, feet, and beak of a white Partridge,
which they call <i>Smæripa</i>, and is call’d <i>Lagopus</i> having feet like the
feet of an hare, thereby implying, that their Daughters must carefully
learn to be cleanly, and like those birds nimble and active. As soon as the
children come to some age, they instruct them in all necessary arts, the
Fathers the boies, the Mothers the girles, for they have no School-masters
among them, but each person is his own childerns Master, and they are so
far put on by their parents as to be able to perform any works in use among
them. Their boies they cheifly teach the Art of Shooting, and hitting marks
with an arrow, because in old time they were necessitated to get their living
by the help of bow and arrows, whereas the greatest part of them maintain
themselves by hunting, and therefore when they have practised never so
little the use of the bow, the boies victuals are kept from them, till they can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
hit a mark with an arrow, and as it was the custom anciently among the
<i>Baleares</i>, and so now among the <i>Laplanders</i>, their boies earn their
food every day by their dexterity in shooting, and thereby at last they
prove most excellent marks-men. <i>Olaus Magnus</i> makes mention of this their
practice, and wonderfully extolls their dextrousness herein, and avers that
he himself has seen some of them who could exactly hit a farthing or a nedle,
set at such a distance off as would just let them see it. On the boies, that
they may take more care to hit the mark, when they have hit it, they bestow
a white girdle, wherein they take huge delight, and sometime a new bow.
But as the <i>Laplanders</i> do look to their children in time to teach them arts
requisite to get their living, so also to provide them means to maintain themselves
withal, where it will not be impertinent to mention, that tis a custom
with them to bestow upon their infant a female Rain-deer, soon after
its birth or Baptism, if it be of female Sex, and upon the horns of it they
ingrave her mark, so to prevent all controversies or quarrels, that may
arise concerning her right. She receives likewise another, when she cuts
her first tooth. Which they call <i>Pannikeis</i>, that is, the tooth Rain-deer.
<i>John Tornæus</i> writes as if these gifts were given only by women. The Woman
saies he, that first spies a tooth in his mouth, is fain to honor him with
a present of a Rain-deers Calve. This custom might probably have its rise
thus, because, when the infants have gotten teeth, they have need of more
solid meat, therefore they stock them with Rain-deer as being their cheifest
food. That Rain-deer then, and whatever encrease comes of it, are preserv’d
to the future uses of the child, as may appear by what we have elsewhere
said, in the Chapter of their marriages, and so likewise of the other
Rain-deer which parents give the child besides, for tis usual among them
to superadd one to the former, and this they call <i>Waddom</i>, that is, the given
one. And this is the chief care of the Parents towards their children,
but if they die, instead of them are substituted Guardians, as among other
nations, out of their nearest kindred, who manage all these affairs for them.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Diseases, Death and Burial.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Tho the <i>Laplanders</i> lead a miserable and hardy kind of life, yet they
enjoy their health perfectly well. They have not so much as heard of
most diseases, and are not all infected with those, that elswhere use to depopulate
whole Countries. There are no acute and burning feavers among
them, no plague. And if any infection be brought among them, it instantly
loses its force. Some years since an infection was brought into <i>Lapland</i> in
hemp, but none were hurt by it, besides the women that in spinning chewed
it, for the Northern cold easily dissipates the poisonous vapors. The ordinary
and frequent disease among them is, sore eies, from whence not
seldom proceeds blindness. The cause of this may be, that from their infancie
they for the most part are forced to be in smoak, wherewith their Huts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
are fill’d both in Summer and Winter. <i>Ericus Plantinus</i> gives the same reason,
and moreover adds the light of the fire to be a cause of it. And this
gives them the greatest trouble imaginable, that their old age usually ends
in blindness. They are often troubled also with the Pleuresy and inflammation
of the lungs, stiches in the back, and dizziness in the head. The
small Pox likewise sometimes takes them. Now as diseases are rare among
them, so Physick is altogether unknown. Against all diseases inwardly they
use the root of a kind of Moss, which they call <i>Jereh</i>, or in the failance
of that, the stalke of <i>Angelica</i>, which they call <i>Fadno</i>, and is any where
to be found. For this use they boil the <i>Angelica</i> with the whey of Rain-deers
milk, as I said it was a custom among them before, in the Chapter of their
food, and so prepared it is made use of as a special Medicine. If they feel
any pain in their joints, they apply some fired chips to the place ill affected,
that the ulcer then made may attract the vicious humors, and so mitigate
the paine.</p>

<p>They cure wounds with no other ointment or plaister then of resin,
which the trees sweat out: if a member be benummed with cold, the Cheese
made of Rain-deers milk affords the presentest remedy to it; they thrust
a red-hot iron into it, and with the fat of the Cheese that instantly distills
from it, they anoint the part affected with incredible success. Others apply
the Cheese it self, slicing it thin like a plate or leafe. This Cheese so
boiled in milk is extraordinary good for a cough, and what other distempers,
either of lungs or breast arise from cold, if it be taken so heated. It helps
the stomach when disaffected by their drinking water. Because diseases are
so rare among them, most of them come to extreme old age. Nay <i>Sam. Rheen</i>
saies there are some among them that live to be above an hundred years old,
and that most of them usually reach 70, 80, and 90 years, and at this age
he saies many of them are still sufficiently brisk and lively; able to manage
their business with expedition, to take a journey, to course thorough Woods
and Mountains, and to perform other such labour: and lastly that they grow
not grey-haired either soon or easily; so that old age dispatches more of
them then diseases do. But if any be so dangerously sick as to keep his bed,
either worn with age, or some distemper, they first enquire concerning him
by their Drum, whither he will recover his health againe or die, as I have
in another place shewn this to be one of the uses of the Drum, and <i>Cl. M.
Matthias Steuchius</i> in his Letter to me tells us the same; <i>I remember</i>, saies
he, <i>I was once told by a</i> Laplander <i>that they can tell the very houre and manner
of any mans death by those their Drums</i>.</p>

<p>When they perceive any one neer death, then if there be present any
well disposed persons, and versed in the Christian Religion, they exhort
him in his agonies to think of God and Christ. If they are regardless of
Religion, they instantly abandon the sick person, carefull only about the
funeral banquet, which they begin sometimes to celebrate before the person
departing is quite dead. <i>Steuchius</i> confirms this by a Story; There was a
rich <i>Laplander</i> named <i>Thomas</i>, who when he was taken with a dangerous
fitt of sickness, so as to loose all hope of recovery, he summond before
him his friends and acquaintance; they when they perceived him to be desperate,
they hasted to the Victuallers that keeps the Inn towards <i>Norway</i>
and <i>Jamptland</i>, and of him they bought Ale and spirit of Wine ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
sacrifice over their friend, whilst he was alive: when they had spent a
whole day in quaffing, they camme to the sick mans Hut, and by that time
found him quite dead. This is an example of the latest date, that hath happened
in these our daies, from whence we may learn how just and reasonable
the complaints were, which were premised to the Charter of <i>Gustavus
Adolphus</i>, concerning the <i>Lapland</i> School. Furthermore, it is customary
if any die, of whatever distemper, all instantly forsake the Cottage where
the departed person lies; for they imagine (which is elsewhere shewn) that
there survives something of the deceased, such as the ancient <i>Latins</i> called
<i>Manes</i>, and that that was not alwaies benign, but sometimes hurtfull: for
this reason they are afraid of the corps of the deceased. And if the person
departed were of the richer sort: they wrap his corps in a linnen garment,
if a poor mean man, in a woollen tattered one, so as to cover over as well
the head, as all the other parts of the body, this they call <i>Waldmar</i>. So
indeed do they that are more observant of the Christian rites then ordinary
there; as for the others, they cover their dead with their own vestments,
and those too the best they had when alive, as <i>N. Matthias Steuchius</i> assures
me by a Letter, and confirms it too by a late example that a person worthy
to be credited, related to him by an Inhabitant of <i>Undersaok</i>, a near neighbour
to <i>Lapland</i>. <i>The body of the dead</i>, saies he, <i>they cover with the best
garments he had alive, and shut it up in a Biere</i>. They lay the corps so wrap’d
up in a Coffin, or funeral Chest, which is done by one peculiarly intreated
to undertake the employment, and who must receive of the nearest kinsman
to the deceased person a ring of Alchimy, and wear it fastned to his right
arm. The reason of so tying this ring is, because they beleive it to be a
preservative against the harm the Manes of the deceased person may otherwise
bring upon them, for this reason he is fain to wear this same ring
till the Burial be over, I suppose, because then they think the ghost may
be more quiet, which is the ancient superstition as well of <i>Greeks</i> as <i>Romans</i>.
The Coffin is usually made of the hollowed trunk of a tree, when
they have not wherewithall to make a Coffin, as is common with them that
dwell in the barren Mountains near <i>Norway</i>, they lay the corps of the deceased
on a Carr or Sledge, which they call <i>Akia</i>, instead of a Coffin.
The place of their Buriall in ancient times, before they turned Christians,
was the first convenient place they met withall for that purpose, especially
a Wood. As for them that dwell at a considerable distance from the Church
at this day, they leave not off the custom of burying them any where where
they first light, with the Sledge too, especially if there are only bare Rocks,
and no Trees to be seen. Others on every side beset the Sledge with the
corps too with stocks of Trees, both above and below, on each side, so as
that it may not contract filthiness or moulder, nor the corps be torn in
pieces, or devoured by wild Beasts.</p>

<p>There are some besides that lay them in Caves, and stop up the mouths
of them with stones. But what <i>Peucer</i> writes that they dig a hole, and lay
their dead bodies under their hearth, thereby to escape the hauntings of
Ghosts, that is neither known nor heard of by the <i>Laplanders</i>: “Whereas
saies he, they are strangely frightned and haunted with the Ghosts of their
kindred after death, they provide against that by burying their bodies
under their hearths: by this only remedy they guard and protect themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
against the hauntings and affrightments of Demons, this if they
do, no ghosts afterwards appear; if they neglect to do it, they are perpetually
interrupted and infested with the apparitions of their too officious
kindred.” They are so far from burying the corps under the hearth
that they rather remove them to as great a distance as they can, But it is a
singular and memorable passage, that those especially who are less observant
of Christian rites, do use to bury with their deceased, first an hatchet,
and next a flint and steel, of which ceremony they give this account, that
if they ever come to rise againe in that darkness they shall have great need
of springing a light; to which the flint and steel may help them, as likewise
there will be occasion for a ready way, wherein they may travell to
Heaven, to which purpose their hatchet may stand them instead, them
especially that are buried among thick Woods, that if any Trees obstruct
their passage, they may cut them down. And this do they themselves at
this day affirm, now they have heard of a last day, and a Resurrection of
the dead. But I suppose it rather to be an ancient superstition remaining
still in these Countries, nor used only by the <i>Laplanders</i>. I my self saw
some few miles distant from <i>Upsal</i>, raked out of the Sepulcher of a famous
person, the great Treasurer of this Kingdom, <i>M. Steno Bielke</i>, a steel and
flint; which that it was a relique only of Paganism, not the place only, but
Tomb over him did sufficiently testify. It is certain that it was the ancient
persuasion of Pagans, that there was no other way for the dead to
arrive at the abodes of the Blessed, but thorough darkness, which they
are the more afraid of, because it is the nature of their Country to have
thicker darkness and of more durance then is usual among others. As concerning
the hatchet, it is no wonder, whereas in other places it is a received
custom to lay by dead People their Weapons, of which the principal
one, among the <i>Laplanders</i>, is the hatchet. As for what appertains to
the modern <i>Laplanders</i>, <i>Olaus Petri</i> imagines that they bury these things
with their dead, because they beleive that after the Resurrection they shall
take the same course of life they lead before, and for that reason they
furnish them with the same utensils. Thus do they who are less observant
of the Christian ceremonies, and dwell farthest off from the Christian
Churches. The others take special care to have their dead carried to the
Church-yard, which too the Priests do earnestly request of them. It is
said too that some of them, when they have bin accustomed to bury in
such a place are so ambitious as to give money to have their deceased buried
not in the Yard, but the Church.</p>

<p>But here none of the <i>Laplanders</i> will willingly dig up a grave, unless he
be extraordinary poor, such whom the richer of them hire at a considerable
rate to such an emploiment, or some other of <i>Swedland</i>, whom they can
procure. So the deceased person is buried according to the Christian rite,
when they have mourned for him, putting on the worst clothes they have,
that is peculiar to them, that they leave behind them the sledg whereon the
course was brought to the Church-yard and all the vestments wherein the
deceased lay during sickness, these they bring to the Sepulcher, for fear
I suppose lest any deadly thing should cling to them, and that cannot be
used by others without harm. So when the Person is buried, a funeral banquet
is provided, the time of it is usually, the third day after the burial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the banquet is furnished out of the flesh of the Rain-deer; that drew the
person departed to his Burial place. That they sacrifice in honor of him;
and all the kindred and acquaintance feast upon it. At this feast they take
special care, not to loose the bones, but gather them all up diligently, and
lay them in a coffer and bury them under ground; if they have the opportunity
of procuring Spirit of Wine, they drink it about to the memory of the
person deceased, and call it <i>Saligawiin</i>, that is the Wine of the blessed,
meaning, I suppose that they drink it to the memory of him, that is happy
by his departure from earth: however it happened, that those kinsmen of
<i>Thomas</i> the <i>Laplander</i>, as was above mentioned, made this feast before the
due time. They fasten upon the coffer, wherein they shut up the Rain-deers
bones, the image of a man fashioned out of wood, bigger or less in proportion
to the deceased person; thus much of their funeral rites. Only some
of the richer sort repeat the feast every year, in the manner aforesaid, where
may note, that the Rain-deers are not only slain for their business of the
feast, but likewise in manner a Sacrifice, and that the bones are offered to
the Manes of the deceased, at tis more largely treated of in another place.
It moreover is apparent that the <i>Laplanders</i> time of mourning is not used to
be short, but of a long continuance, especially for the loss of married persons
or children, and consists not in ostentation, or appearance, but only in inward
sorrow. I come now to their manner of inheritance and division of their
goods, which follows upon the death of any one, for the <i>Laplanders</i> likewise
have their sort of riches, consisting most in moveables as cattle, silver, brass
and copper vessels and the like, but there is nothing for which they are more
esteemed then plenty of Rain-deer. Some of them have a hundred, some
a thousand or more; <i>Olaus Magnus</i> makes mention of but half these numbers
<i>Lib.</i> 17. <i>Cap.</i> 28. but what may be read in the papers of <i>John Buræus</i>,
confirms their number to be much greater. <i>Oroveen</i>, tis there said, was so rich
in Rain-deer, that their number could not be known. <i>Arent Justinus</i> stole
a hundred of them, and yet they could not be missed. And other things
which serve for daily uses, they keep in public, or else lay up in their cupboards,
as I have elsewhere shown, but they bury under ground either silver
plate or mony, and the place they call <i>Roggri</i>, they lay it first in a close
box, that in a copper kind of kettle, and that they cover over with boord,
and so strew it over with earth and moss, that no body may perceive any
thing to be hid there, this they do so privatly, that neither their wives nor
children can tell any thing of it, so that it sometimes chances, that, when
they dy suddenly, all these things ly buried and never come to the heirs, but
what come to their hands are thus divided among them, if they be moveables,
the Brother receives two thirds, the Sister one, as was appointed
by the Provincial Laws of the <i>Swedes</i>. The two <i>Rain-deers</i> given to the children
in their tender years, the one the Tooth Rain-deer, the other the Parents
free gift, are exempted from this common division, as likewise their
increase, which sometimes comes to a considerable number. If the goods
be not moveables, as territories, lakes, mountains and such like, the children
of either Sex, possess them with equall right, and make use of them
indifferently, tho this be not a bare permission, but founded in the division
of <i>Lapland</i>, made by <i>Charles</i> the Ninth, in which to every family were
given its own territories, Lakes, Woods, Mountains, and the like, as has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
been mentioned in another place, from whence I suppose tis, that they remain
still to each single family, and are not liable to division or to be distributed
among the heirs as other goods; for these are not their own proper
possessions, as other goods are, but only granted from the crown of <i>Swedland</i>
to them to receive the profits, and upon that score every year they pay
a certain tribute, which we have treated of before, so that there remains
nothing else to be added here.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Cattel.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">After our discourse of the inhabitants of <i>Lapland</i>, their Nature
and manners, something is to be said of other things there remarkable.
First of their Cattel, of which they have some common to other Nations,
some proper only to themselves. They have no Horses, nor Asses,
Oxen, nor Bulls, Sheep nor Goats. The inhabitants do not regard Horses,
for the little use they have of them; Oxen, Sheep, Goats, they procure from
their Neighbors, for the provision of meat, wool, and hides, and they keep
them but one Summer, still killing them a little before Winter. The Beasts
proper to <i>Lapland</i> which no other Nation has, are Rain-deers, <i>Peucerus</i>
stiles them <i>Tarandi</i>, but without reason, for the Rain-deer compared with
<i>Tarandus</i> as ’tis described by <i>Pliny</i>, have scarce any thing a like, the <i>Tarandus</i>
having the bulk of an Ox, an head bigger than a stags, and hair as thick
and rough as a Bears, which he can change into any color, as he shews in
his 8<sup>th</sup> book, but nothing of this agrees to the Raindeer, as we shall shew
anon. Likewise <i>Gesner</i> did erre in bringing this Animal from two divers species.
’Tis not known who imposed the name; but whatever become of the
Etymology or imposition of the name, tho it seem to be of late times, the beast
it self was long before known. The first that wrote of him was <i>Paulus
Warnefrid</i>: he speaks there of a people which he calls <i>Scritobini</i>, which were
doubtless the <i>Laplanders</i>, for he describes their cloths to be the same with
those which the <i>Laplanders</i> call’d <i>Mudd</i>, he affirms that the beast of which
they had their hides was not unlike a Stag, which serves to prove that they
were the <i>Rain-deer</i>, for so they are call’d by <i>Herbestenius</i>, <i>Damianus</i>, and
<i>Olaus</i>, who tells us that they are something taller then a Stag: those which
have broad horns (found most in the North) are less than others. But tis
not the same thing to talke of tallness and bulk; for tho other Stags owe their
height to their long legs, they have less bodies than the Rain-deer. They
have 3 horns, 2 branching out backward, the third sprowting down their
foreheads (which <i>Olaus</i> observes is to guard them from the wild Beasts especially
the Wolves.) <i>Lomenius</i> speaks of 4 horns, 2 backwards and 2 forwards,
as appears by his picture, in which the Artist falls short of the matter,
as my draught which is more accurate will show: but <i>Albertus Magnus</i> makes
them have three rows of horns, for so <i>Jonstonus</i> out of him, they carry saies
he 3 horns, each breeding 2 horns more, which makes his head seem bushy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Two of these are bigger then the rest, which answer to the Stags horns,
growing sometimes to that bigness as to be 5 cubits high, and are adorned
with 25 branches. The Doe has 2 short horns, one being fixt in its forehead
which it uses in conflict with other beasts. These horns are proper only to
the Buck, the Doe having much less and fewer branches. They are commonly
covered with a kind of Wool, which is most frequent after they are cast
and begin again to shoot; so <i>Olaus</i>. In the spring, they begin to sprout, tender,
but rough and full of blood: when they come to a sufficient growth,
they cast their hair in Autumn. The Rain-deer differ from a Stag, that their
feet are thick like a Bulls; hence <i>Olaus</i> took notice of their round hoofs:
when they walk, the joints of their feet make a noise like the clashing of flints,
or cracking of nuts, which is peculiar only to these beasts. Lastly their color
is different from a Stags, for it comes nearer an Ash: besides they are
white not only on their belly but on their haunches, which <i>Damianus</i> observes
does render them more like Asses then Stags, and <i>Zeigler</i> agrees
with him. But I cannot see on what account <i>Olaus</i> attributes a main to this
beast: they have indeed, especially under their necks, hair longer then ordinary,
such as Goats and other beasts have, but nothing agreeable to an horse
main: tis farther observeable that tho they are cleft they do not chew the
cud. Likewise instead of the bladder for their gall they have a black passage
in their liver. This is the picture of one drawn to the life.</p>

<img src="images/zill_t130.jpg" width="600" height="523" alt="reindeer" />
</a>
</div>

<p>Moreover the beast is naturally wild, and such still abound in <i>Lapland</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
but now multitudes are tamed for domestick service; those that are bred
of tame ones, remain so, of which there is great plenty. There is a third
sort bred of the wild and tame, for they use, as <i>Sam. Rheen</i> observes, to
set out tame Does about rutting time, for the better conveniency of catching
the wild ones. Thence it happens that sometimes the tame ones breed
that third sort, which they call particularly <i>Kattaigiar</i> or <i>Purach</i>, and are
bigger and stronger than the rest, and fitter to draw Sledges. He saies
too that they retain something of their primitive wildeness, sometimes being
very headstrong, and kicking at him that sits on the Sledge. The driver hath
no remedy then but to turn his Cart, and lie under it, till the Beast ceases to
be unruly, for they are strong, and will not be governed with whips. They
go a rutting about S. <i>Matthews</i> tide, in the same manner that Staggs do: if
any Buck be killed in that Season, the flesh stinks like a Goats, which makes
the Inhabitants desist from killing them at that time, but at other times
they are good meat. The Does (which they call <i>Waijar</i>) are big ten months,
they calve about <i>May</i>, when they can recruit themselves with the Sun, and
fresh grass. They breed but one a piece, but are so fertile, that of an hundred
there is not ten barren. Those that have calved are stiled <i>Raonæ</i>, which
become exceeding fleshy, as if they were fatned against Autumn, at which
time they are usualy killed.</p>

<p>Those that have young ones never are housed, but give suck without,
and in this case the great multitude breeds no confusion, for each Doe
knows her proper Calf, and is known by it; so saies <i>Sam. Rheen</i>, who affirms
that they know one another after two or three years absence. When
the Calves are grown they feed on grass and leaves, and what the Mountains
afford: their color is mixt of red and yellow. About S. <i>James</i> tide
they cast their hair, which in the next growth turns blackish. They are at
their full growth in 4 years, each year changing their name; the first, they
are stiled <i>Namiloppa</i>, i. e. nameless. <i>Tornæus</i> calls the Buck <i>Hiroas</i>, but <i>Rheen</i>
gives him the name of <i>Herki</i>. When they are able to work, they are tamed;
one sort being condemned to the Sledge, and thence named <i>Vaijom-herki</i>,
others to carry burdens, thence called <i>Lykam-herki</i>. Those that are design’d
for labour they commonly gueld, which renders them more tractable: this
is done when they are a year old. Those which are reserved for breeding,
are called <i>Servi</i>. The Bucks are not so numerous as the Does, of which there
be an hundred for twenty, which are profitable for Milk, Cheese and breeding.
Both men and women milk them kneeling, one hand being emploied
to hold the pail, and the other the dugg. They milk them sometimes loose,
and sometimes bound to a post, about 2 or 3 of the clock in the evening,
and but once a day, the rest being reserved for the calves: those which have
Calves alwaies yield most milk: the greatest quantity they give at once is
a Swedish pint and half, that is about the fourth part of the ordinary measure
upon the <i>Rhine</i>. The milk is fat and thick, and very nurishing, which
is their chiefest food; that which they do not boil they make Cheese of, which
is thus described by <i>Rheen</i>. The Dairy-Maids first let the milk stand to
cream, when it hath stood they take off the cream with a skimmer. When
one Cheesefat is filled, they fill another, and put it on the first, and so till
6 or 8 are filled, then they turn the Cheesefats, that the lowermost be
in the top, and use not their hands to press the cheese, but let them press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
each other. Each Cheese requires as much milk as ten Rain-deers can spare:
their shape is round about two fingers thick, and as big as a Trencher,
which we use at table, their Milk makes very fat Cheese, but no Butter,
instead of which they have a kind of tallow, as I shew’d before.</p>

<p>Now the <i>Laplanders</i> having such advantages from these beasts, take great
care in driving them to their Meadows, and defending them from wild Beasts.
They are so concerned for them, that they bring their Wives, Children,
and Servants, to watch them in the pastures, and drive those that wander
back to the Herd. When milking time comes, they drive them into folds,
which are spots of ground, hedged in with hurdles stuck on forks, each
fold having two doors, one by which they enter, the other which carries
them out into their Medows. Their meat in Summer is the best grass the
Mountains afford, with leaves of young Trees. They avoid all hard rough
grass, especially where Bullrushes grow. The other Seasons of the year
they feed on a kind of white Moss, which abounds in <i>Lapland</i>: when the
Mountains are covered with Snow, they scrape out this Moss with their
feet. And <i>S. Rheen</i> observes that tho they get least food in the Winter
quarter, they grow whiter and fatter then at other times, for in Summer
the excessive heat makes them worse. These Cattel too are subject to disseases,
which if once begun, spread and kill the whole Herd, but this very
rarely. They are infected with that more frequently, which <i>Olaus</i> describes.
About <i>March</i> worms or wornels do begin to breed in their backs, which
when alive, creep out and make the Beasts skin, if then killed, full of holes,
like a Seive, and almost useless.</p>

<p>The Wolves trouble them, tho they have their horns to defend themselves;
but they are not alwaies so armed, for they cast their horns once
a year, which grow again very slowly. The Does never cast theirs till they
have calved. The Rain-deers use not their horns when they encounter the
Wolves so much as their forefeet, with these they receive them coming on,
otherwise their feet defend them by flight, which they can easily do, if
not hindred by Snow. The third inconveniency is that if they be not very
carefully lookt to, they will wander and be lost, therefore the owners put
certain marks on them to distinguish them from others; their marks they
put sometimes on their ears, and not their horns, because they cast them.
But if they escape all accidents whatever, they never live above 10 years.</p>

<p>And thus much for the Rain-deers, which alone supply the want of Horses,
Sheep, and other Cattel. Therefore the Inhabitants apply themselves only
to the care of these, neglecting all the rest; besides Dogs, which faithfully
watch their Houses and Cattel, and are very serviceable for hunting, as
I have mentioned in that Chapter.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the wild Beasts of the</i> Laplanders.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Of all the Beasts in <i>Lapland</i> the Bear is chief: him saies <i>Sam. Rheen</i>,
they stile King Of the Woods, and gives this reason, because in
strength and fierceness he exceeds all the rest. They are very numerous,
some fiercer than others, especially those which are mark’t with a white
wreath about their necks, many of which are found in the North. These
annoy the Inhabitants Cattel, and overturn their Stores; which they fix
on the top of a Tree, to preserve their flesh and fish, and all that concerns
provision: but in one night the Bear destroys all the food they
have laid up.</p>

<p>Next the Bear the Elk is remarkable, which <i>Olaus</i> calls the wild Asse,
<i>Scaliger</i> confounds it with the Rain-deer, for he saies, tho it had Asses
hair, it was called by the <i>Swedes</i>, <i>Ranger</i>, by the <i>Goths</i>, <i>Rangifer</i>, by the
<i>Germans</i>, <i>Ellend</i>, by the <i>Moscovites</i>, <i>Lozzi</i>, and some Books say that in
<i>Norway</i> they were named <i>Rehen</i>: what Books he means I am ignorant, but
I am sure the <i>Elks</i>, which the <i>Germans</i> call <i>Ellend</i>, were never called <i>Rehen</i>,
but <i>Ælg</i>, or <i>Ælgar</i>, which is now the common name through all
the North; neither can I think otherwise of the <i>Moscovites Lozzi</i>, for it
is the same with the <i>Lithuanian Losso</i>, as <i>Herbestenius</i> observes. That which the
<i>Lithuanians</i> call <i>Loss</i>, the <i>Germans</i> call <i>Ellend</i>, and many in Latin <i>Alce</i>.
So that <i>Loss</i>, <i>Lozzi</i>, <i>Ælg</i>, <i>Ellend</i> is the same Beast, but quite different
from the Rain-deer, contrary to what <i>Scaliger</i> thought. For first it excells
the Rain-deers in bulk not a little, being as high as any Horse; its horns
are shorter, but above two palms in breadth, shooting out a few, tho not
many young sprouts. His leggs are not round, but long, especially the
foremost: he engages very smartly, and his sharp hoofs enable him to encounter
all Men and Dogs that oppose. He hath a long head, and huge thick
lips alwaies hanging down; his color is not so white, but all over his body it
inclines to a dark yellow mixt with ashen: when he walks he makes no noise
with his hoofs as all Rain-deers do; whoever sees both Beasts (as I have
often) will perceive such difference, that he will wonder how any one should
mistake. There is no great breed of these in <i>Lapland</i>, but they have them
from other places, especially <i>Lithuania</i>. <i>Charles</i> the ninth, by a public
Proclamation claimed all the skins of those that were killed for his Exchequer,
as I mentioned in another place. <i>Olaus</i> saies that they continue
altogether in the South of <i>Lapland</i>, and are taken most frequently by
running them down, or hunting; in other places they are rarely found:
but it is manifest that twice a year they swim in great Herds out of <i>Carelia</i>,
over the River <i>Niva</i>, to wit, in the Spring to go into <i>Carelia</i>, and
in Autumn to return into <i>Russia</i>. Some few Stags have bin seen in <i>Lapland</i>.
<i>S. Rheen</i> mentioning the chief Beasts which have bin found there, reckons
severall species of four footed Beasts, as wild Rain-deers, Bears, Stags,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Wolves, Gluttons, Beavers, Otters, Martins, Squirrels; but these Stags
are but few and little, such as they call <i>Damacervi</i>, or <i>Platicerotes</i>, which
since they have nothing peculiar from those in other nations, let it suffice
that they are named. To these I may add wild Rain-deers, but because
they differ from the tame ones only in bulk, being bigger, and in color
somewhat blacker, I will likewise pass them over. <i>Sam. Rheen</i> after the
Stags mentions Wolves, of which there is a great number, distinguisht
from those in other Countries only by their color, something whiter,
whence they are often called white Wolves: their hair is thicker, longer
and rougher. These most of all molest the Rain-deers, which are armed
against them with their horn.</p>

<p>I find in some Papers of <i>Euræus</i> that the Wolves did never assault the
Rain-deer if it was bound to a stake: the reason may be because he fears
some trap when he sees the rope that binds the Raindeer: for the Wolf
is a very suspicious creature, and thinks every thing he sees to be a snare
to catch him. Besides he may suspect that men lie hidden to kill him, whereas
the Rain-deers are only bound for the better conveniency of milking them.
Nevertheless, the Wolves venture not only on Beasts, but on Men and
Women, especially those that are big with child. Travellers are forced to
go armed, particularly Women near their time, for the Wolves take their
scent and watch more greedily for them, therefore no Woman is permitted
to travel without a guide assisting her. The next are the Gluttons,
which are frequent here, they have a round head, strong and sharp teeth,
like a Wolfs, a plump body, and feet shorter than the Otters: their skin
is of a very dark color, some of them resemble Sables, only they have
softer and finer haire; this Beast lives not altogether on Land, but many
times in the Water, like the Otter, tho much bigger and stronger: some
compare it to the Otter, but it is far greedier than he, for thence it
gets its name. For <i>Olaus</i> tells us that it is called by the <i>Swedes</i>, <i>Jerff</i>, by
the <i>Germans</i>, <i>Wildfras</i>: but this German name doth not denote the Beast
to eat much, but to devour what it finds in the Woods, for <i>wild</i> signifies
any thing in the Woods; wherefore either <i>Scaliger</i> did not understand
the word, or else the Printer did not follow his copy: which appears more
plainely, from that the <i>Gulo</i> doth not only infest wild Beasts, but tame (as
hath bin often known in <i>Swedland</i>) and Water creatures too, being it self
accustomed to the Waters.</p>

<p>There are abundance of Beavers in <i>Lapland</i>, because the Nation abounds
with plenty of Fish, whence they have store of food: <i>Olaus</i> thinks that the
plenty of them proceeds from the quietness of the Waters, which are never
troubled with Ships, as the <i>Rhine</i> and <i>Danow</i> are. I add nothing of these because
they are not distinguish’d from the vulgar sort, neither are the Otters.
Next to these <i>Sam. Rheen</i> speaks of the Foxes, as being numerous, and
of severall sorts over all <i>Lapland</i>. He reckons up, besides the common ones,
those that are black, brown, ash-colored, white; and those that are marked
with a cross. The black are most valued because they are rare: in <i>Moscovy</i>
Men of honor and preferment have their Caps made of their skins, which
are sold, as <i>Herberstenius</i> observes, for 10, sometimes 15 pieces of gold.
Those that are marked with a cross, <i>Johnston</i> calls <i>Crucigeræ</i>, and describes
them thus: they have from their mouth, over their head and back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to their tail a black streak, another crossing their back, and down to
their forefeet, which two lines do resemble a cross. These are preferred
before the common red Foxes, being bigger, and having thicker hair. The
ashen-colored Foxes are those which <i>Johnston</i> calls <i>Isatidæ</i>, their color is
mixt of ash and blew, such as is the color of the woad, tho this color is
not spread all over his body, nor is any single hair wholly of this color,
for the longest hairs are black at the end, the shortest white, from both
which this color results. <i>Olaus</i> calls these <i>Celestine</i>, or sky-colored Foxes,
where too he tells us that they are of less worth than the rest, and the
white ones too, because their color is so, without the tincture of any other,
such as Conies use to have. The reason is because their number is great,
and their hair not durable: but that there is such abundance of these skins
happens because the Foxes are more easily taken, not living in the Woods,
but on the naked Mountains between <i>Norway</i> and <i>Swedland</i>.</p>

<p>After the Foxes the Martins are mentioned. These too are frequent in
<i>Lapland</i>, and indeed no Nation doth afford more or better skins than this
doth. But these differ too, those that have yellow on their throat being
preferred before the white: but this is observable that the <i>Laplanders</i> have
no Martins but in the Woods, and they have also a particular sort of meat,
for they feed on Squirrels and Birds. In the night time, saies <i>Olaus</i>, by
the advantage of their sharp claws they can easily climb any Tree, where they
make a prey of the Squirrell, who is quite as nimble, tho not so strong,
and therefore can sometimes save himself by skipping round the arm of a
Tree: this the enemy cannot imitate, especially if the Squirrell leads him
up to the top branches, otherwise he cannot escape, and leap from the
top of one Tree to another. The Martin is not injurious only to the
Squirrel, but to both small and great Birds, which he seizes on as they are
at roost: if they be the greater Birds they presently betake themselves to
flight with him sitting on their backs, and persisting to bite so long, till
they drop down dead.</p>

<p>Next are the Squirrels, which are incredibly numerous. These particularly
change their color every year. When Winter draws on they turn
from red to grisle, which color is valued in the skin; this color the further
the Beasts are Northwards, is the purer, and less mixt with red, and
is so too the farther the Season is from Summer, at which time they are
never hunted, but all in the Winter. Tho they do so abound, yet they
are wont to go away in such troops, till there are scarce any left. The reason
of their departure is not known: some think it is because they fear hunger
and foresee the want of meat. Others think it is to avoid the injury of
the weather. <i>Rheen</i> and <i>Ol. Pet.</i> describe their march on this wise. They
go to the brinks of a River, where they find the bark of Pine, or Birch
trees, on which they trust themselves, and venture to launch forth, pricking
up their tailes for sailes. Thus they are carried at the mercy of the
wind till it overturns them and their bark. Their body is of that nature
that it will not sink, but being drowned, is driven to shore, where very often
great numbers are taken up, and their skins, if they are found soon enough
are as fit for use as ever: but, tho such an accident, as this, sweeps away
most of them, yet the few that are left preserve the species, and multiply
very soon, for each Squirrel brings forth 4, 5, or more at a time. And
those are all the Beasts which <i>S. Rheen</i> mentions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>But besides these, there are others, such as are the <i>Sables</i> which <i>Olaus Magnus</i>
calls <i>Zabelli</i>, their skins <i>Johnston</i> in his History of Animals commends.
<i>Olaus</i> saith that their skins were made use of by the <i>Lapland</i> Women, especially
by the Brides to adorn themselves with them; and that there is but small
plenty of them in these parts. Some make this beast like a weezel, others
especially <i>Scaliger</i> like the Martin, and indeed he seems to be in the right
both to the bulk and shape of it. Their color the nearer it comes to black is
the more esteemed. There are found several all white, such as we have often
seen the <i>Muscovian</i> Embassadors bring over to the King for a most singular
present. By which <i>Adamus Bremensis</i> in his <i>Scandinavia</i> seems to have understood
white Martins. There are also Ermins which are found only among
the <i>Laplanders</i>. <i>Jovius</i> first wrote of them that they were good exchange
for any sort of Merchandize. These Ermins are nothing but white weezels
having the end of their tails black, <i>Johnston</i> takes notice thereof out of
<i>Albertus Magnus</i>, he calleth the beast <i>Erminius</i>, which is the same thing with
<i>Armelinus</i> and <i>Hermelinus</i>, differing neither in bigness nor nature from the
weezel, the color argues nothing, for he has that only in Winter, but in
Summer is of a bright yellow. It is as greedy of Mice as the Weezels are,
whence the <i>Sweeds</i> call it <i>Lekat</i>. I am unwilling to call it with <i>Scaliger</i> a
<i>Swedland</i> Mouce. Among these I had rather reckon a little sort of beast
which they call <i>Lemmus</i>, which <i>Olaus Magnus</i> saith the Ermins feed on,
<i>Samuel Rheen</i> speaks of a sort of Mice found in Lapland which they call
Mountain Mice or <i>Lemblar</i>, which <i>Wormius</i> describes with short tails and
staring hair, and not unlike a Mouce. I will speak little of their color, which
<i>Olaus</i> saies is various, <i>Samuel Rheen</i> affirms it red, who observes too that
they come of a sudden, and cover the ground with their multitude. <i>Olaus</i>
observes that this is alwaies in stormy weather, and thinks that it rains these
creatures, but is all together in a doubt, whether they are brought thither
by the Winds, or bred in the clouds. <i>Wormius</i> thinks plainly that they are
bred in the clouds: but the learned <i>Isaac Vossius</i> in his notes to <i>Pomponius
Mela</i> corrects him, and saies the reason why these animals are supposed to
fall from the Clouds is because they use not to appear, but immediatly after
rain they creep out of their holes, either for that they are fill’d with water,
or because this creature thrives much in rain, which opinion seems most
probable to me. These creatures are very bold, never making their escape
when Passengers come by, but keep on their way, and make a noise like
the barking of a dog: they fear neither club nor sword, but if any one strike
at them, they turn again and bite. It is observable in them that they never
go near or do any mischeif in any hut, sometimes they set upon one
another, being divided as it were into two armies, this the <i>Laplanders</i> take
to be an omen of future war in <i>Swedland</i>, and gather whence the enemy
will come, by observing whence those animals first moved that provoked
the rest. These creatures have their enemies too, first the Ermines as I mentioned
before, then the Foxes, which bring a great number of these into
their holes: hence the <i>Laplanders</i> have no small disadvantage, for the Foxes
using this sort of food most, regard not the baits which they lay to catch
them. Thirdly the Rain-deers devour them, and lastly the dogs which eat
only the fore part of them. These creatures never live, if they chance to
eat any herb grown after they had tasted it before: sometimes they perish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
otherwise, as being choaked in the Hedges or dropping into Water. The
last sort of beasts are hares, which are esteemed for their white skin, especially
in the winter, at which time they are as white as the Foxes; they
change their color every year, alwaies turning white towards this season; for
which tho many reasons may be given, I think this is most considerable, that
Nature and Providence designed it, least when the ground was quite cover’d
with Snow, their color might easily discover them, and they being
equally oppressed by man and beast should be quite destroy’d. For which
reason too, probably some birds at that time are White. <i>Olaus Magnus</i> testifies
the same of hares, that immediatly after Autumn they begin to grow
white, and at that time are frequently taken half white and half not, but
in the midst of the Winter they are all white as before.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Birds and Fish.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">I come now to the Birds, of which here is great store. <i>Samuel Rheen</i>
mentions these, Swans, Geese, Ducks, Lapwings, Snipes, all sorts of
water Birds, and wild fowl, as Heathcocks, Stock-doves, Partridges,
Woodcocks; he makes a distinction between water fowle and those that are
bred in Woods, and proves that they abound with each sort, because the
country has so many pools, ponds, and woods. Of these birds, some are in
other countries, some only in these Northern parts. Swans, Geese and
Ducks, are known every where: he means wild ducks, for they have no tame
ones. <i>Olaus Petri</i> takes notice of the same thing. It is remarkable in these
wild foul, that they come from the South into the North, where they build
their nests, hatch and breed up their young ones, which is not frequent elsewhere.
I believe it is because they do not find such security nor plenty of
food in other places. The Snipes I suppose are scarce found any where else,
their back and head are black, and most part of their wings, white on their
breast and belly, red bills, very long, and set with teeth, short feet and red
with skin between their claws, as all water fowle have. As you may see in
the next page.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<a href="images/zill_t138h.jpg">
<img src="images/zill_t138.jpg" width="600" height="470" alt="snipe" />
</a>
</div>

<p>To this we may add that sort of Bird called <i>Loom</i>, which <i>Samuel Rheen</i>
omitted, unless he comprehended them under the water-fowle in general,
for there is such a number of them, and so various, that the particulars would
take up too much time: <i>Olaus Wormius</i> has a draught of this bird, it is no
sort of duck, as appears by its bill, which is not broad but sharp. This bird
peculiarly goes not upon land, but alwaies either flies or swims, it hath feet
very short for the proportion of its body, and standing so much back, that
tho they are very convenient for swimming, yet it cannot so poise its body
on land as to be able to go: hence it is called <i>Loome</i>, which signifies lame or
unable to go. Of the wild fowl that which <i>Samuel Rheen</i> calls <i>Kiæder</i> and
we render <i>Wogallon</i>, intimating the biggest sort, is named <i>Cedron</i> near <i>Trent</i>,
if <i>Gesner</i> may be credited, who describes the rest very probably: but as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the color of the Hen, which he affirms does differ nothing from the Cock, he
is mistaken; for the color is quite yellow with black specks. The same may
be observed of the Stock-doves which he calls the lesser <i>Urogalli</i>, for the
hen differs from the cock, he being all black, and she yellow, like the hen
of the Heathcock, from which she is distinguist by nothing but bigness. <i>Olaus
Magnus</i> because the Color was not exactly yellow, called it ashen, for
sometimes it is composed of both these, most enclining to an ash. There are
no other sort of wild cocks, then those the <i>Sweeds</i> call <i>Orrar</i> and the Latines
<i>Tetraones</i> or <i>Urogalli minores</i>: their combs are the same with the <i>Urogalli</i>,
placed not on the top of their heads, but above each eie, which the painter
not understanding drew them from his own tame cocks. Some call these birds
Pheasants, but whoveer compares them, will discern two distinct species.
Both sorts are found in <i>Lapland</i>, but the latter not so frequent; nor are the
others equally plentiful every year, for in some there are none. I come now to
the woodcocks, which I think is the right name; the <i>Swedes</i> have a bird which
they call <i>Jærpe</i>, and the <i>Germans</i> <i>Haselhun</i>, but it is doubted whether these
are the same with the woodcock, for they do not frequent marshes as the
woodcocks do, but live altogether in woods and groves, whence <i>Rheen</i> reckons
them among that sort of fowle which inhabit the woods. However,
there is plenty of these birds in <i>Lapland</i>, and they afford good meat for the inhabitants;
but no bird abounds there more then the White Partridge, not only
in the woods but on the highest Mountains, even then when they are covered
with Snow. I call it <i>Lagopos</i> which <i>Samuel Rheen</i> sometimes <i>Fialriipor</i>
or <i>Snioeripor</i>, the <i>Germans</i> and especially the <i>Helvetians</i> term is <i>Schnæhuner</i>,
<i>i. e.</i> Snow-hens, or <i>Shnævoigil</i>, <i>i. e.</i> Snow-birds, because they delight in
Snow and to dwell on the top of the Alpes. They have a kind of hair instead
of Feathers, and hears feet, whence they are called <i>Lagopodes</i>. <i>Samuel
Rheen</i> describes them thus, that in the Winter they are as white as Snow,
having not one black feather, but that which the Hen has under her wing:
when spring comes they turn grey like hen pheasants, and keep that color
till Winter. <i>Olaus Magnus</i> mentions a sort of snow birds, which naturally
changes its white into ashen, but I can scarce believe he means the <i>Lagopodes</i>,
because he speaks of their red feet, such as Storkes have, whereas the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<i>Lagopodes</i> much differ. Another thing <i>Samuel Rheen</i> observes, that the <i>Lagopodes</i>
never sit on trees, as <i>Olaus</i> his Snow-birds are painted, but are alwaies
on the ground very active, scarce ever sitting still. Their shape is this.</p>

</div>

<p>The next is their Fish, of which they have incredible store; <i>Zeiglerus</i> saies
their draughts are so great, that they are forced to transport some of them
into other Countries. <i>Jovius</i> speaks too of great plenty they reap from the
Seas, because he is describing those <i>Laplanders</i> which live near <i>Muscovy</i>:
whereas the rest can have plenty enough out of the rivers. The best sort
they have is Salmon, for which <i>Olaus Magnus</i> saith there is not better fishing
in any part of <i>Europe</i>, then in the Bothnic towards <i>Lapland</i>; whose mountains
send down vast rivers of fresh water, against which the Salmons come
in such shoales, and with such vigor, that the Fishermen find them at the
head of the river on the top of the mountains. <i>Samuel Rheen</i> too prefers
these fish before all the rest, and saith that they swim up all rivers that they
are able, and come down again about S<sup>t</sup> <i>Matthews</i> tide. And that is much
worse when it returns, then when it went up, which seems to be, because tis
wearied and spent in strugling against the stream, and engendring; which
it alwaies does in those parts of the river which are most remote from the
Sea: when he comes up the river they call him <i>Salm</i>, at his return <i>lax</i>.</p>

<p>The 2<sup>d</sup> sort of fish are Pikes, <i>Olaus Magnus</i> speaking of this saith, that in
<i>Lapland</i> there are marshes of fresh water, 400 <i>Italian</i> miles in length, and
100 in bredth, in which there is such abundance of Pike and other fish, that
they do not only supply 4 Kingdomes, but are dried and transported farther
into <i>Germany</i> to be sold: these fish alwaies use fresh water, and are every
where known having long heads, the lower jaw hanging out, many sharp
teeth, which the Germans call <i>Hecht</i>. They are found sometimes to exceed
men in length. <i>Olaus</i> affirms, that if they have fresh water and food enough,
they will attain to 8 foot in length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The 3<sup>d</sup> sort are those which the <i>Swedes</i> call <i>Syck</i>, not much differing from
the Carp; only they have longer mouths, and not so broad, they are commonly
not so big as carps, but in <i>Lapland</i> they are found extraordinary,
sometimes weighing 10 or 12 pounds.</p>

<p>The 4<sup>th</sup> sort is <i>Abbor</i> which is with us a perch: this is very plentiful too,
and frequently of an incredible bigness. There is to this day in a Chappel
at <i>Luhlah</i>, kept one of their heads dried, which is from the top to the under
jaw 2 spans thick. There are found water-weezels red and white, chiefly in
the pools near the Sea. <i>Samuel Rheen</i> speaks of 2 sorts which the <i>Swedes</i> call
<i>Ræding</i>, and <i>Ærlax</i>; whether they are any where else found I know not.
<i>Rheen</i> thus describes the first sort. <i>Ræding</i>, has its name from the red color
on the lower part of its belly. The latter is very like a Salmon but not so big.
Some take them for Salmons not come to their full growth, but this is an error,
for these fishes are taken in pools, which are on every side parted from
the Sea, and are known never to have any Salmons. I had rather refer them
to the trout, or <i>Trutta</i>, because it scarce differs in shape, only the Trouts
flesh is redder and softer. Besides these there are many other fish in <i>Lapland</i>,
but not regarded, because they serve not for food, for which reason I
pass them over: only <i>Olaus Petrus</i> gives us this doubtful account of their
names, <i>Salario, Cobitis, Barbatula, Rubellio, Borbocha ocutala, Prasinus, Cyprinus,
Cobitis aculeata</i>. This Country breeds not many reptiles, no serpents:
but this is meant of the upper Regions towards the <i>Norway</i> Mountains, for
in the low woody places they are found tho not many. There are but few insects;
as for fleas they are quite unknown; but they receive much injury
from gnats, which infest man and beast, especially the Rain-deers, which
upon that account are driven away to the top of the highest Mountains. The
men arm themselves against them by keeping a continual smoak in the house.
If they sleep, they put a blanket over their body and head: when they go abroad
they put on a garment made of hides, and on their heads cloth caps.
I have bin told by the Natives, that many to defend themselves from this insect,
dawb their faces all over, except their eies, with resine and pitch.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are great wasps which trouble the Rain-deers, and
sting them so deep, that sometimes they leave marks behind them even when
the beast is flayed: those little holes which they make with their stings the
vulgar call <i>Kaorme</i>. The only remedy for the Raindeer against these, is smoak,
which if not present they dip themselves in water: and let this suffice for
their Animals.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the</i> Laplanders <i>Trees and Plants</i>.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">I descend from their Animals to their Trees and Plants, with which they
are well stored, tho <i>Jovius</i> observes that they have no fruit Trees, as
Apple, Pear, &amp;c. neither have they any wild Trees which will not bear
the cold, as Oak, Beach, which <i>Ol. Pet.</i> takes notice of, but adds that
they have plenty of Pine and Fir, Juniper and Birch, Service tree, and
Willow, Alder and Dog-tree, the Asp and Ollar: but these Trees do not
grow every where, for the Mountains called the <i>Fells</i>, between <i>Norway</i>
and <i>Lapland</i>, bear no Trees at all: <i>Pet. Claud.</i> thinks the reason of that
to be the continual storm of wind that is on them, but perhaps a truer reason
may be the extremity of cold. The ground that lies near the Mountains is
thick set with Woods, with this distinction that the parts next them bears
nothing but Birch tree, remarkable for their thickness and height, and
pleasant prospect, Nature having contrived them so regularly that they
seem afar off to be some pleasant Garden. The soil more distant from those
Hills, besides Birch-trees, hath Fir and Pitch, which seems like some new
kind of wood, composed of these three sorts.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are very few others found in <i>Lapland</i>. Shrubs, especially
Currans, or Ribes are very frequent, but they regard not these
because perhaps the tast is unpleasant, especially of those which bear
Black-berries, which are more numerous than the others. The Junipers grow
thick, being very tall and comely. This Country yields all manner of Berries,
the chief are those which the <i>Swedes</i> call <i>Hiortron</i>, some Dew-berries,
or the <i>Norway</i> Berry, whose species is the same that grows on Brambles,
each Berry being divided as it were into graines of a pale yellow color,
beginning to be red as they ripen. These commonly grow in marshy places.
They creep on the ground, and are sustained by little props, so that they
ought not to be reckoned among shrubs. The Berries are very wholsome,
and are a present remedy for the Scurvy. The Inhabitants delight to eat
them with their flesh and salt meats, as I mentioned before. They have a
sort of black Berries, called by the <i>Swedes</i>, <i>Halton</i>, according to <i>Olaus
Pet.</i> also the thin leaved heath, that bears a Berry, which some call ground
Ewe, the <i>Swedes</i>, <i>Kraokebær</i>, the lesser black Berries called in <i>Swedland</i>
<i>Lingon</i>, and the lesser black Berries called <i>Blaobær</i>, all which <i>Olaus Pet.</i>
takes notice of, speaking of their manner of dressing meat, particularly
of the Heath-berries: whence it appears that these Berries were as plentifull
with them as the former. They have all sorts of other Berries, tho
the Natives do not so much value them. This Country affords very usefull
Herbs, such as are Angelica, which the Inhabitant value so much that they
call it the <i>Lapland</i> herb, or Samigraes: they are much pleased with it in
their meat: it grows with a short stalk, but thick. In the same place is found
Sorrel, which they use too in their food. Some particular herbs they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
which are not found any where else, as <i>Calceolum Lapponicum</i>, or <i>Brassica
Rangiferorum</i>: what sort of herb it is <i>Sam. Rheen</i> expresses in these
words, which, tho tedious, I thought fit to transcribe that we might have
his exact opinion it. There grows (saith he) an herb which they call <i>Calceolum
Lapponicum</i> because its flower is like the <i>Laplanders</i> shoe, it is of a
blew colour with three rowes of seed in the pod, it has larger leaves than the
vulgar cabbage, its stalk is a finger thick and the root bitter: it grows extraordinary
fast, and rises to three cubits in height, and somtimes more: it is
thought a bad and unprofitable herb because no beast will tast of it. There
is another herb very usefel and wholesome, and of great esteem among them,
which <i>Olaus Pet.</i> take to be like a carrot, he says it is called <i>Mosaraoth</i>, haveing
the tast and flower of Pimpervel growing in marshy grounds to an ell in
height. That <i>Mosaraoth</i> is not a <i>Lapland</i> but <i>Swedish</i> name, from <i>maosa</i>
which signifies marshy places where mosse grows, what the inhabitants call
it, I cannot yet learn. And these are the peculiar herbs which this country
hath: I have not met with any one that could help me to the exact shape of
them. But altho this soil beare some peculiar herbs, yet there are not
many species of them, which <i>Olaus Pet.</i> gathers from the <i>west-Bothnia</i>, which
borders on <i>Lapland</i>, for in that place there are found but very few.</p>

<p>I come now to Mosse, which is of diverse sorts. The first is tree Mosse,
with a kind of long wool, hanging down from the boughs, especially of the
Pitch tree, and somtimes from others. The 2<sup>d</sup>. which is very plentiful and
affords food for the raindeers in the winter is ground Mosse, of a white colour,
with long thin leaves growing a foot high. The 3<sup>d</sup>. is ground mosse, but softer
of a more delicate yellow green: this is pernicious to the foxes, which the inhabitants
cut small and mix with their baits to catch them. The 4<sup>th</sup>. is also
ground mosse, short and soft, of a very fine colour, which because it is so fine
they use instead of feathers to lay under Infants new born. I hear of a 5<sup>th</sup>. sort
with larger and longer leaves, which they call <i>Fathne</i>, good against fainting
if it be bruised and drank in broth, but I doubt whether this be Mosse, I
had rather believe it <i>Angelica</i> cut small prepared and boiled under ground.
The last thing which is to be mentioned is Grasse, which is of diverse kinds,
the best sort is that which is found in the vallies near the mauntains called
<i>Fells</i>, being short, soft, and juicy; that which grows in other places is thicker,
rougher, and dryer. There is a 3<sup>d</sup> sort thin and slender which the inhabitants
use for stuffing of their shoes, and gloves, to defend their feet and hands
from the weather. And these are all the trees, shrubs, and herbs of <i>Lapland</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Mettals.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">That mettals grow in <i>Lapland</i> and the outermost parts of <i>Scandinavia</i>,
is only a conjecture of the Antients, and there is no certainty of it,
therefore none of them make any mention of them. <i>Olaus M.</i> flatly denies
that to his age there were any Iron, Copper, or Silver mines found, therefore
they were forced to fasten their boats with osiers, without any nails
because they had no Iron, but in the 35. year of this age, in <i>Queen Christina’s</i>
reign, a silver mine was discovered by the Inhabitants of <i>Pitha</i> near <i>Nasafialo</i>
not far from the mountains which divide Swedeland from Norway, this
was the first mine known in <i>Lapland</i>, found by <i>Loens Person</i> an inhabitant
of <i>Pitha</i>.</p>

<p>In the year 1645. <i>The most Illustrious Ericus Flemming L. Baron of Lais,
now Senator of the Kingdome, and President of the company of Mines</i>, first
caused it to be opened, and a melting-house built with convenient necessaries.
There is also a vein of Lead richer then the Silver and easier work’t. <i>Rheen</i>
saith that the mountain is opened, not with Pickaxes or any Iron instruments:
but they bore a hole, which must be fill’d with Gunpowder; when the mouth
is well stopt they apply fire thro another little hole, which touching the
powder breaks the hardest stones in pieces. But the use of this mine lasted no
long time, for in the war between the Swedes and Danes in <i>Carolus Gustavus</i>
his reign about the year 1658. it was spoiled by one <i>Van Anen</i> the Danish
Kings Governour, from which time no man would go to the expence of cleansing
and repairing the mine, because it would require a vast charge, before
they could get any profit by it, which was too much for men of mean
estates to undertake.</p>

<p>The 2<sup>d</sup> Silver mine is in <i>Luhla-Lapmark</i> named <i>Kiedlkievasi</i> found by <i>Jonan
Petri</i> living in <i>Torpenjaur</i> about the 60. year of this age. It is in the
middle of the Village <i>Torpenjaur</i>, on an high mountain 2. miles from the top,
6. miles from <i>Rædstad</i> a village of <i>Norway</i>, between <i>Rædstad</i> and <i>Keidlkievasi</i>;
there is a famous high hill called <i>Daorfiæl</i> in the road that leads from the
mine to <i>Norway</i>: the foul weather in the winter stops all passage over this
mountain. The mine is rich enough and very broad, continuing the same all
over, lodged in a hard Marcasite. It has this inconvenience that there are
no woods near it, but they are forced to fetch their fuel a mile and a half off:
they use powder instead of digging it, (as before) the melting-house stands
5. miles off in a pleasant place near the concourse of several Rivers, especially
<i>Darijock</i> and <i>Quickjock</i>, which last gives the house its name. Here is a
very spacious wood and great plenty of shrubs, especially currans, and all
sorts of herbs. The river affords abundance of the best sort of fish as Salmon,
Trout, Perch, &amp;c. distant 27. miles from <i>Taorne</i> discovered in 1655. by an
inhabitant who was showing the ore to <i>Ericus Ericsonius</i> who first discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
it. It is very rich and not drossy, only necessary’s are conveyed thither with
some difficulty. There is another 3. miles northward called <i>Wittange</i>, found
by a <i>Laplander</i> in 1668. The vein is not so good because mixt with Iron,
wherefore they do not dig it so willingly as the Other; from these mines the
ore is shipt away to the melting-house at <i>Koenge</i> to be melted and thence
brought to <i>Torna</i>. There are Iron mines too, one in <i>Torne-Lapmark</i> joyning
to the Copper mine, another in the same <i>Lapmark</i> called <i>Junesuando</i> found
in 1640. by <i>Laurence</i> an inhabitant there, about 22. miles distant from <i>Torna</i>,
whether it is carried to be beaten into bars and rods at the forge at <i>Koenge</i>.
A 3<sup>d</sup> vein of the same mettal is found in <i>Pelziwachin</i> at <i>Lulha</i>, but of these the
two first only are digged. I heard in 1671. of a Golden mine: but because
there was no certainty, I will not insist upon it. I mention it because there
are some that affirm that it was found in <i>Swedeland</i> in the time of <i>Gustavus</i>
the first, but this was divulged by an uncertain Author, as appears by the event,
for to this day nothing more has bin heard of it.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Stones, Jewels, and Pearls.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">I come now to their stones, which are very large and many, of an ash colour
but rough hard and intractable, not to be reduced by any instrument
to shape for use. Besides these there are others often found on the shores
which represent the shape of an animal. These the inhabitants esteem much
and adore them for Gods, under the name of <i>Stoorjuncare</i>. In <i>Torne-Lapmark</i>,
near the mine <i>Junesuando</i>, on the banks of <i>Torno</i>, there are found yellow
plain stones of a circular figure like mony, about the bigness of a half crown,
which look like dirt, but are as hard as flints. <i>Dn. Grape</i> in his papers makes
mention of them. I will set down a draught of them marked with the letter
B. In the mine it self there are found stones in the perfect shape of <i>Octaedra</i>,
polished and worked by nature herself, but very small not exceeding the bigness
of a nut, and somtimes less, I have put down their figure with the letter
C. It is not certain whether the loadstone be found in this Country, tho <i>Olaus
Mag.</i> speaks of mountains under the pole which some have thought do breed
the stone: his words seem to intimate loadstones as big as mountains, but ’tis
certain he cannot mean <i>Lapland</i>, for that has none such, yet there are those
who affirm that the loadstone is found there. As for pretious stones they
have them frequently, <i>Buræus</i> mentions jewels, and afterwards he adds <i>Diamond</i>,
<i>Amethyst</i>, and <i>Topaz</i>. By diamonds he means transparent stones or Chrystal,
they are found big and little sticking up and down upon the rocks and
craggs: some are as big as Childrens heads, such as I saw the <i>Illustrious Gabriel
de la Gardie</i> Chancellour of this kingdom have; they have six sides ending
like a pyramid, tho some of them are imperfect; the colour in some
is bright and clear not inferior to Chrystal, in other dull and spoiled with
flaws, some are pure, others have veins like cracks branching out every way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
they serve the inhabitants for flints when they have occasion to light a candle,
and yield more fire if striken with a steel than the flints themselves. I have
now in a <i>Lapland pouch</i> some Chrystal which they made use of for flints. The
Jewellers polish and cut their Chrystals with such art that somtimes they are
taken for true Diamonds by those that have skill. I have drawn the greater
sort of Chrystal in the native bigness &amp; shape, marked with the letter <i>A</i>. <i>Buræus</i>
mentions <i>Amethysts</i> next, some of which I saw brought out of <i>Lapland</i>, but
so pale and spotted that they were scarce comparable to those that come out of
<i>Bohemia</i> tho I hear since that there are much better found, cut rarely. The same
thing is to be said of the <i>Topaz</i>, one of which I have in my study, in every
thing like a Chrystal, only the colour inclines to a yellow. I am told
that none of the rest doe shine so much as those that come from other places,
which is the fault of almost all the jewels of this Nation, not being so apt
to bare lively brisk colours as the eastern jewels doe. To this head I reduce
all Pearls and Margarites, tho they be not stones. Some rivers in <i>Lapland</i>
produce these, therefore there are certain inhabitants appointed to dive
and search for them, such as was <i>John Peterson</i>, mentioned by <i>S. Rheen</i>,
who first found the Silver mine at <i>Nasafiæl</i>, he is called <i>een diamontzbrycare
sampi partefoekiare</i> <i>i. e.</i> one that finds and cuts pearls. Which (tho out of
this Country) are not contemptible, it cannot be denied but that most of
them want that liveliness which the oriental Pearls have, tho some are found
as good, and in bigness and shape exceeding them. There are found some not
come to perfection, half round and half flat, the round part being bright the
other yellow and dull. I saw one a few years agoe brought out of <i>Bothnia</i>, so
exactly round with such fresh colours, that a certain woman offered an 120.
crowns for it, a Jeweller assured me that if he had another as good, he would
not sell both for 500. They are bred not of such shells as are in the east
broad, plane, and almost circular like Oister, but longer and hollower like
Muscle shels, and not in the Sea but in Rivers, as may be gathered from <i>Olaus
Magnus</i>. Those that are not come to perfection stick within the shells, but
those that are perfect, are loose and drop out when the shell is opened.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Rivers.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Lapland if any Country is well watered with springs and rivers: the
most noted are those from whence the particular marches and regions
have their names, as <i>Umeao</i>, <i>Pitheao</i>, <i>Luhleao</i>, <i>Torneao</i>, and <i>Kimeao</i>, these
spring from the <i>Norway</i> mountains, and are encreased by several less rivers,
unburdening themselves at last into the <i>Bothnick</i> Sea. <i>Vindela</i> fills <i>Umeao</i> and
<i>Skiellefle</i> <i>Pitheao</i>, <i>Luhleao</i> swallows a less river of the same name, and <i>Kimeao</i>
is encreased by <i>Avilaiocki</i>, which it self is no small river, for there are numberless
rivulets which run into it. So <i>Luhleao</i> which has a double stream,
the lesser receives <i>Pyrrijaus Kardijoch</i>, and it is the same case with the greater
called <i>Stoor-Luhleao</i>, and <i>Tornæo</i> which is filled with the river <i>Kæungemæ
Tængeleao</i> and others. And so it is with all the great rivers, which upon that
account are so impetuous and big, that they yield to few in the world: and
because they run through hilly and uneven Countrys, and are stopt by several
dams &amp; weares, they force their way over precipices, with a great noise,
and in those places are not navigable. Such is the sluce at <i>Lughlens</i>, called
<i>Muskaumokke</i>, and another named <i>Sao</i>, likewise <i>Niometsaski</i> i. e. an Hares
leap, so called because the river <i>Lughla</i> runs between two mountains so near
that an Hare may leap over.</p>

<p>The like <i>Cataracts</i> are found at <i>Torna</i>, the most remarkable is called <i>terrafors</i>
near the <i>Norway</i> mountains. Next <i>Cængerbrooks-fors</i> then <i>Lappia-fors</i>,
then three more meeting in an head called by one name <i>Pælloforser</i>, next
<i>Kettille-fors</i> and lastly <i>Kukula-fors</i> near <i>Torna</i>. Although these <i>Cataracts</i> are
a great hindrance to sailers, yet they are advantagious to the mettal-melters,
and afford an incredible plenty of Fish. Besides these rivers there are abundance
of pooles, so numerous that but few can be named, one is <i>Lulafræsk</i> by
<i>Lughla</i>, by which <i>Lughleao</i> the greater runs. Next <i>Lugga</i> and <i>Sabbaig</i> all
abounding with Salmons. By the lesser <i>Lughleao</i> are <i>Saggatt</i>, <i>Ritfack</i>, <i>Pirrijaur</i>,
<i>Skalka</i>, <i>Sittijock</i>, <i>waykijaur</i>, and <i>Karra-green</i> which exceeds them all,
each affording plenty of Fish. <i>Pitha</i> has these remarkable ones near it, <i>Hornafvandijaur</i>,
<i>Arfussierf</i>, <i>Pieskejaur</i>, but especially <i>Stoorafuan</i> in which there
are as many Ilands as daies in the year; but above all <i>Enarefræsk</i> near <i>Kimus</i>.
<i>Wexionius</i> saith the Hills and Ilands in it are innumerable, and without an
hyperbole, for <i>Tornæus</i> affirmes that never any inhabitant lived long enough
to survey them all.</p>

<p>There be some Marshes, little but full of Fish, in that language called <i>Suino</i>
i. e. holy, and they account it a sin to foul them. These marches have two
Channels one above the Other: somtimes it happens that the fish leave the
upper and retreat into the lower, upon which account the superstitious natives
bring sacrifice to appease the <i>Dæmon</i> of that marsh whom they suppose to
be angry.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Mountains.</i></span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Their land which I treat of last, is not in the same condition all over,
for that which is near <i>Bothnia</i> is wholsomer and more fertile for all
sort of pot-herbs, as those can witness who have made gardens in both soils.
They found that some places would bear coleworts, raperoots, parsnips, radishes
and the like. In other places by reason of the abundance of rocks and
rivers, the ground is too moist and stony, and sandy in many places, which being
scattered by the wind covers the ground like snow, such are those places near
the mountains of <i>Norway</i>. These sands make a very dangerous passage for
travellors, especially when they are covered with snow, because then they
cannot tell what they are to avoid, somtimes falling in and being overwhelmed.
Towards <i>Norway</i>, are very high mountains which the <i>Swedes</i> call <i>Fiæl</i>
the <i>Laplanders</i> <i>Tudderi</i>. <i>Cluverius</i> calleth the top of the mountains <i>Sevo</i> which
he took from <i>Pliny</i> l. 4. c. 13. By <i>Adamus</i> they are called <i>Riphæi</i>, but he was
to careless in looking over <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Solinus</i>, and <i>Orosius</i>. But whatever the name
is, what <i>Pliny</i> saith is true of the mountain, that it is no less than the <i>Riphæan;</i>
the top is perpetually covered with snow. Moreover the ascent and rise
of this mount is thus described by <i>Pet. Nevren</i>: the mountain which separates
<i>Norway</i> from <i>Lappia</i> begins to rise about <i>Zemptland</i>; thence with continued
ascent towards the north it reaches a hundred miles, till it comes to <i>Titusfiord</i>,
which is a bay of the frozen sea. By this mountain the provinces of <i>Swedeland</i>
are divided from <i>Norway</i>, as by a wall designed by nature herself. But
altho these mountains are one continued tract, yet they swell higher in some
places than others, called by these distinct names, which <i>Samuel Rheen</i> mentions.
<i>Waesawaari, Skipoive, Nasawari, Ceruioiue, Kioldawaari, Niottuswagg,
Keidtkiwaari, Zeknawaari, Fierrowaari, Cardawaari, Steikawaari,
Skalopacht, Darrawaari, Woggousaari, Niynnas, Kaskaoiue, Wallawaari, Skieldawaari,
Harrawaari, Portawaari, Kafla, Seggock Ultivis.</i> In like manner
there are many other of their names in the other parts of this Country,
but because it is hard to meet with them all, and not so much to our purpose,
wee’l end now.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
